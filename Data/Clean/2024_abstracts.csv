1,Navigating the fragmented thornscrub: using fine-scale movement data to assess disparate responses to fragmentation in a declining galliform,"Anthropogenic impacts force organisms to function in novel ways, and species must
either alter their behavior or disperse away from these pressures to persist. In South Texas,
Tamaulipan thornscrub has been subject to widespread degradation and fragmentation as a
result of brush management practices such as brush removal. The chestnut-bellied scaled quail
(Callipepla squamata castanogastris; hereafter “scaled quail”) is a declining, ground-nesting bird
that is uniquely dependent upon the Tamaulipan thornscrub. By studying the fine-scale
movement patterns of scaled quail, we may better understand how brush management
practices are affecting the functionality of Tamaulipan thornscrub. From February 2022 to
August 2023, we fit 129 scaled quail with GPS transmitters that recorded locations every four
hours at ranches in Duval and Dimmit County, Texas, USA, representing areas of declining and
stable populations, respectively. Landscape variables (i.e., road density, oil/gas development,
and vegetation structure/landcover) were included in integrated step selection functions to
examine how multiple mechanisms of brush removal influenced spatial responses of scaled
quail across spatiotemporal scales (four-hour and twelve-hour temporal grains). Across both
study sites and temporal grains, selection for thornscrub and avoidance of sandy mesquite
shrublands and grasslands was evident, though disparate responses (avoidance or selection) to
landscape variables (i.e., total core area of habitat) and anthropogenic features existed across
different spatiotemporal scales. Our results highlight the complexity of spatial responses to
thornscrub fragmentation, which are context-specific. Accounting for disparity in responses can
better inform larger connectivity models focused on managing metapopulation dynamics.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition
2,Science and Policy Behind Plans for Reintroducing Ocelots to Historic Range in Texas,"In 2021, a new collaboration was established to re-energize recovery efforts for
endangered ocelots (Leopardus pardalis pardalis) in Southern Texas. The focus was to develop
plans to reintroduce an additional ocelot population to a part of the cat’s historic, but now
unoccupied, range in Texas. To support reintroduction planning, our objectives were to identify
a reintroduction site, model ocelot reintroduction at the site, write plans for breeding and
reintroducing ocelots, and create a policy proposal for ocelot reintroduction that would address
private landowners’ concerns about expanding the range of a federally protected species. First,
we developed a geospatial habitat suitability assessment that identified a suitable reintroduction
site in South Texas based on a suite of ecological and socio-political factors. We then used
population viability analyses to build a demographic model of ocelot reintroduction at the
selected site and compare possible release strategies. We found that ocelot releases must be
implemented long-term to establish a viable population. We used information from these
scientific analyses to develop protocols for implementing the reintroduction program. Finally, we
integrated all information into a proposed Programmatic Safe Harbor Agreement that will
support ocelot recovery while also protecting the interests of private landowners whose lands
are necessary for ocelot reintroduction. Our study provides the scientific and policy framework
for plans for ocelot reintroduction. It has also shown how universities, agencies, conservation
organizations, and landowners can work together to design innovative plans for conserving
endangered species on private lands.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition
3,Comparing behaviors and demographic outcomes for extant and translocated eastern wild turkeys in east Texas and west-central Louisiana,"Abundance of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) in east Texas has
been unstable at best, leading to ongoing restoration efforts. Our objective was to evaluate
behavioral decisions and subsequent demographic outcomes by comparing translocated and
extant eastern wild turkeys across east Texas and west-central Louisiana. GPS data was
collected from 222 extant adult females (nTX  = 25, nLA = 197) and 45 translocated adult
females only in east Texas. Translocated females had lower nest success (x ̄ extant = 0.14;
x ̄ translocated = 0.08), produced less nests per potential hen (x ̄ extant = 1.37; x ̄translocated =
1.13), and had worse annual survival than extant females (x ̄ extant = 0.75; x ̄ translocated = 0.65).
Extant females in Louisiana and Texas had similar nest success (x ̄ TX = 0.14; x ̄ LA = 0.14) but
varied in nests/potential female (x ̄ TX = 1.72; x ̄ LA = 1.32) and annual survival (x ̄ TX = 0.66; x ̄ LA =
0.76). Prospecting for mates and resources should be done in the first nest pre-laying period,
where we saw the biggest behavioral differences between translocated and extant females.
Range size was double (x ̄ extant = 521 ha; x ̄ translocated = 1090 ha) and the probability of
sharing space was much less likely (Probextant = 0.70; Probtranslocated = 0.54) for
translocated adult females. These pre-laying behavioral differences are due to a lack of
landscape familiarity for translocated females, which lead to direct demographic consequences
tied to finding mates, identifying resources, and avoiding predators. These behavioral
differences are likely the driving force behind the depressed demographic outcomes for
translocated eastern wild turkeys.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition
4,Influence of Traffic Volume on the Carnivore Community Composition within the Road Effect Zone,"Disturbance from vehicle noise and human activity extends into nearby habitat,
creating a road effect zone characterized by changes in the wildlife community structure and
species’ behavior. This can impact conservation efforts along roads, such as wildlife crossing
construction. To ensure that conservation efforts are effective, we must understand how
mammals use road areas. We set camera traps along a low-traffic highway on the East
Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch in Willacy County and a high-traffic highway on the Hacienda
Yturria Ranch in Kenedy County from May 2022 to April 2023. We set camera traps using a
randomized block design with transects set perpendicular to the highway. Seven camera traps
were set in each of seven transects, at 200 m intervals, starting 50 m from the highway. We
assessed how traffic volume and distance from highway affected the mammal community
composition. We detected nearly all known mammal species larger than rodents (n=24),
including all known carnivores (n=10). The mammal community showed differences in
community structure near the low-volume highway, near the high-volume highway, and far from
both highways. Community composition was more variable around the high-volume highway
than the low-volume highway. Our study provides information on how mammals use road effect
zones and how vehicle traffic impacts use. By comparing a low-traffic highway to a high-traffic
highway, we provide information to landowners and the Texas Department of Transportation
about how traffic volume could impact management practices on working lands around
highways and future conservation efforts for mammals living around roads.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition
5,Pronghorn Susceptibility to Prion Diseases Through PRNP Sequencing,"Prion diseases such as Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) are a concern to wildlife
managers, public health officials, and the public.  Given the complexity of prion transmission,
and history of spontaneous generation of novel prion diseases, the possibility of interfamilial
transmission has become a concern. Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) utilize similar habitat
as susceptible Cervids and occur within the endemic CWD area of Colorado and Wyoming.
However, no published literature specifically on pronghorn susceptibility to prion diseases
including CWD exists, as they have been assumed to be resistant.  In Texas, pronghorn occur
in portions of both the Texas Panhandle and the Trans-Pecos regions, which both contain
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department CWD surveillance zones.  Our goal was to sequence the
prion protein gene, PRNP, exon 3 in pronghorn from Texas and New Mexico to compare to
amino acid sequences of known susceptible Cervids and assess if pronghorn could be
susceptible to prion diseases. We amplified and sequenced PRNP from 47 individuals from
Texas (including intra-state translocated individuals) and 28 individuals from New Mexico using
standard PCR techniques. Phylogenetic analyses were utilized to compare alignment of PRNP
in pronghorn to that of known, prion disease-susceptible ruminants. Our research identified that
pronghorn have one additional octapeptide repeat, for a total of 6, rather than the 5 peptide
repeats present in Cervids. Additionally, pronghorn share similarities to Cervid genotypes
characterized by codons 95, 96, 116, 132, 225 and 226, indicating that pronghorn possess all
the amino acids correlated with greater susceptibility to prion diseases in",oral,Cottam Awards Competition
6,Nonbreeding ecology of female northern pintails and links to fitness,"The northern pintail (Anas acuta; hereafter pintail) remains below population
objectives and investigating nonbreeding ecology may untangle some uncertainties of
nonbreeding conditions influencing fitness. Our objectives were to investigate winter landscape
structure on pintail energy expenditure, and to assess the efficacy of winter wetland
management on spring migration performance. Female pintails were captured in different
wintering regions in the US and fitted with tracking devices. In objective one, we calculated daily
home ranges for each pintail during winter, calculated daily step-lengths (km), and daily Overall
Dynamic Body Acceleration (ODBA, a proxy for energy expenditure). Land-cover datasets were
reclassified into either water, development, grasslands/pasture, or cultivated grains. We
calculated several FRAGSTATS metrics. We conducted Generalized Linear Mixed Models
(GLMMs), with landscape metrics as predictors and daily ODBA and daily step-lengths the
responses. We found increasing water decreased step-lengths and increasing
grassland/pasture increased ODBA and step-lengths in pintails. In objective two, we calculated
the proportion of GPS locations on both managed and non-managed sites for each pintail. We
calculated four spring migration metrics: departure date from wintering area, number of
migratory stopovers, total migration duration, and arrival date to breeding areas. Using GLMMs,
we regressed spring migration metrics on proportional use of managed sites. Greater
proportional use on managed sites resulted in a significantly earlier departure from wintering
areas and earlier arrival on breeding areas. We show wetland management allows pintails to
arrive on breeding areas sooner and our findings are expected to help resource managers
optimally place sanctuaries within landscapes.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition
7,Evaluating Use of Rangeland Analysis Platform Data to Develop Site-Level Habitat Relationships of Northern Bobwhite,"Remotely sensed imagery has been increasing and becoming readily available for
managers to use in management. The Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) is a publicly
available resource that provides estimates of biomass production and percentages of cover for
various plant functional groups. The objective of our research was to evaluate the feasibility of
using RAP data to quantify habitat-relative abundance relationships for northern bobwhites
(Colinus virginianus).  We conducted quail roadside surveys on 13 sites (n = 1‒5 routes/site, n =
28 total routes) across South Texas during August‒September 2022 to estimate mean bobwhite
relative abundance (no. of bobwhite/km).  We buffered survey routes 400 m on both sides and
obtained habitat data (annual forb and grass cover, perennial forb and grass cover, bare
ground, litter cover, shrub cover, and tree cover) from RAP, and annual and seasonal
precipitation from PRISM. We used a generalized linear model to evaluate the influence of
habitat or precipitation on bobwhite relative abundance. We documented a negative response
with litter cover (pseudo r2 = 0.13) but a positive response with perennial forb and grass cover
(pseudo r2 = 0.19).  In addition, bobwhite relative abundance was positively related with annual
precipitation (pseudo r2 = 0.39).  These findings are in line with ecological expectations and
provide evidence that RAP may be a useful resource in bobwhite research and management.
Our results suggest that managers may be able to minimize bobwhite population lows during
low annual precipitation by managing for perennial forb and grass communities with low litter
cover.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1
8,"Assessment of Scaled Quail Habitat Selection and Movement Behavior on an Active Oil and Gas Field in the Permian Basin, Texas","Oil and gas development influences wildlife through various factors across space,
species, and ecoregions. Research highlighting how oil/gas development affects the already
declining scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) populations of Texas remains understudied,
especially in the Permian Basin region. We sought to evaluate how scaled quail habitat
selection and movement behavior are affected by oil and gas development and supplemental
quail feeders in the Permian Basin of West Texas, USA. Additionally, we were interested in
habitat selection and movement behavior variation across seasons. We used integrated step
selection analysis to identify which environmental and/or anthropogenic factors affected scaled
quail habitat selection and/or movement behavior across well pad densities (0.5 pads/km2 and
5 pads/km2). We determined that monthly vegetation greenness, distance to well pads, distance
to supplemental feeders, and various movement variables significantly affect scaled quail
habitat selection and movement behavior. We then utilized principal component analyses to
discern whether differences occurred across intensities and seasons. We found that scaled
quail do not select habitat or move differently across well pad densities or seasons. However,
their niche expands considerably during the winter months of the non-breeding, covey season.
This suggests that scaled quail reduced intraspecific competition as resources decreased
through expanding their niche breadth. Furthermore, we identified the existence of diel activity
patterns in habitat selection and movement. These results suggest that wildlife managers
working with oil companies should continue to focus on land restoration efforts and consider
implementing supplemental feeding to manage scaled quail populations.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1
9,Exploring Drought-Legacy Effects in Northern Bobwhite in Texas,"Abstract: A drought-legacy effect is a phenomenon whereby current-year responses
of an ecosystem are affected by prior-year(s) rainfall. Drought-legacy effects have been
documented in grassland ecosystems, but it is unknown whether such legacy effects also
influence wildlife dependent on these systems such as grassland-bird species. Northern
bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations in semiarid rangelands are strongly influenced by
rainfall. Thus, it is plausible that bobwhite populations in arid environments are subjected to
drought-legacy effects. Our objective was to quantify the relationship between bobwhite
abundance and current-year and prior-year Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (PMDI).
Our study focused on bobwhite populations of northern Texas (Rolling Plains and Cross
Timbers and Prairies) and southern Texas (Rio Grande Plains and Gulf Prairies and Marshes).
We used a long-term dataset (1978–2022) of bobwhite relative abundance collected by Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) using roadside surveys and a corresponding dataset of
PMDI to analyze the influence of current- and prior-year PMDI (i.e., drought-legacy effects) on
bobwhite abundance in each region. We documented a significant interaction between current-
year and prior-year PMDI in northern Texas (P ≤ 0.0001) and southern Texas (P = 0.0014) and
thus evidence for a legacy effect. The response of bobwhites to current-year PMDI increased
significantly (P ≤ 0.05) when prior-year PMDI changed from drought (PMDI = -4) to normal
(PMDI = 0) to wet (PMDI = 4). Our findings show that a drought-legacy effect exists and
influences bobwhite abundance in northern and southern Texas.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1
10,Influence of Rainfall on Northern Bobwhite Reproduction,"Quail populations in semiarid environments experience drastic fluctuations, which are
strongly influenced by rainfall. Despite decades of research, the mechanisms driving this
relationship are unknown. While past research has focused on the materialized effects of
rainfall, we propose that rainfall itself, or closely associated factors, influence population
dynamics by serving as reproductive cues. Rainfall may provide supplemental information that
stimulates quail reproduction in sermiarid environments. Our study evaluated rainfall itself a as
reproductive cue for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) in semiarid rangelands. During
April—August 2023, we housed northern bobwhite hens (n=30 hens) in outdoor aviary cages
that were subject to ambient environmental conditions. We collected blood before and after
rainfall events to monitor changes in reproductive hormones and recorded eggs daily. We
measured reproductive hormone (i.e., luteinizing hormone, LH) concentrations in blood samples
using ELISAs and calculated egg-laying rates. We also deployed autonomous recording units at
8 sites (1 unit/site) across South Texas to monitor changes in wild bobwhite calling behavior
before, during, and after rainfall events. We used the web application BirdSong to detect wild
bobwhite calls in our bioacoustic recordings and calculated calling rates. Here we report
changes in bobwhite reproductive behavior (LH, egg laying, and calling rate) as a function of
rainfall events and discuss the implication of these findings.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1
11,Demographics of Northern Bobwhite Translocated to the Pineywoods Ecoregion of Texas,"Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) have largely disappeared from the
Pineywoods of Texas. Restoration of populations has been successful in the southeastern
United States following translocation. We radiomarked and translocated 120 bobwhite from
Florida to a 3,622-ha area in Polk County, Texas. Sixty bobwhite were translocated in January
2023 and the remainder in March. We monitored bobwhite daily to estimate demographics of
the two cohorts. During 6 January to 17 October 2023, cumulative survival was 0.52 (95% CI =
0.39–0.65) and 0.28 (95% CI = 0.17–0.42) for January and March cohorts, respectively. We
entered breeding season (April 15) with 54 females (nJanF = 25, nMarF = 29) and 55 males
(nJanM = 27, nMarM = 28); the first nest was observed on 9 May and 6 May for January and
March cohorts, respectively. We found 74 nests; nest incubation rates were 1.06 nests/female
(NRJanF = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.61–1.38, NRMarF = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.84–1.64) and 0.31
nests/male (NRJanM = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.20–0.69, NRMarM = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.19–0.50).
Pooled across sexes, nest success was 49% (NSJan = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.31–0.64, NSMar =
0.52, 95% CI = 0.33–0.70). Productivity was 5.09 chicks/female (CRJanF = 5.19, 95% CI =
4.39–6.15, CRMarF = 5.00 chicks/female, 95% CI = 4.25–5.88) and 1.35 chicks/male (CRJanM
= 1.22, 95% CI = 0.87–1.72, CRMarM = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.08–1.99). Overall, demographics
were comparable to growing populations.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1
12,The Influence of Landcover and Weather on Northern Bobwhite Population Growth in Texas,"Northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) inhabit semi-arid rangelands and open
woodlands in the United States, and their populations have been experiencing distribution-wide
declines for the past century. Habitat loss and fragmentation have been hypothesized as
potential factors driving the population decline at large spatial scales; however, long-term
changes in weather (i.e. rain, temperature, and soil moisture) traditionally have not been
considered as contributing factors. The objective of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis
that habitat loss and long-term weather trends influence bobwhite population growth in northern
and southern Texas. We used 2019 National Land Cover Data as well as historical (1978–1992)
and projected (1992–2022) land cover data from the United States Geological Survey to assess
bobwhite habitat connectivity and configuration. We also used data from the National Centers
for Environmental Information to quantify weather within each region using Palmer Modified
Drought Index values. Here we report on the influence of habitat amount (%) and weather
(PMDI) on bobwhite population growth and discuss the relative importance of each. Our findings
will 1) provide a better understanding of the degree to which fragmentation and weather
influence bobwhites in Texas, and 2) help guide species conservation at regional scales.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1
13,Reproductive status limits thermoregulatory behavior in white-tailed deer,"Altering space use and diel activity patterns are animal behaviors that balance
energetic needs and thermoregulation. However, reproduction increases energetic requirements
and limits thermoregulatory efficiency. We assessed how environmental temperature influenced
when and where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter “deer”) foraged and
accessed water depending on reproductive status. We monitored activity patterns associated
with foraging and drinking at shaded/unshaded feed stations of six pregnant and 11 non-
pregnant captive deer using camera traps May through August 2022 in Kingsville, Texas, USA.
We measured black body environmental temperature and identified periods of extreme heat
(daily mean > average high).  We recorded 5,785 foraging and 7,117 drinking events and
analyzed the coefficient of activity overlap ( d̂; range: 0 [no overlap] to 1 [complete overlap])
between pregnant and non-pregnant deer at different environmental temperatures and
locations. Drinking activity overlap of pregnant and non-pregnant deer was similar during
periods of lower temperatures (daily mean <35°C; d̂=0.93, CI:0.90-0.94) and higher
temperatures (daily mean >35°C; d̂=0.90, CI:0.87-0.93). However, foraging activity overlap of
pregnant and non-pregnant deer at lower temperatures was 13% greater ( d̂=0.90, CI:0.87-0.92)
than at higher temperatures ( d̂=0.77; CI:0.72-0.82). Moreover, diel activity overlap between
pregnant and non-pregnant deer at shaded feeders was 7% greater at lower temperatures
(d̂=0.92, CI: 0.90-0.95) than higher temperatures ( d̂=0.85, CI: 0.78-0.91), whereas activity
overlap at unshaded feeders was 15% greater at lower temperatures ( d̂=0.91, CI:0.89-0.94)
than higher temperatures ( d̂=0.76, CI:0.68-0.82). Collectively, our results demonstrate
pregnancy has strong effects on diel activity patterns, and those effects are most pronounced at
high temperatures.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1
14,Drivers and Consequences of Mule Deer Site Fidelity in a Highly Dynamic Landscape,"Site fidelity is observed across taxa and predicted to improve familiarity with the
environment and individual or population performance. Human disturbance, however, may alter
the benefit of this previously adaptive behavior. We examined site fidelity of 125 GPS-collared
mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) across four populations in the Texas Panhandle from 2015 –",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1
15,Thermal drivers and consequences of foraging behavior in white-tailed deer,"Foraging behavior is a key determinant of nutritional condition, which governs
individual and population-level performance. Foraging behavior is influenced by numerous
factors; however, little is known about the effect of thermal conditions on foraging behavior or
the physiological consequences of foraging decisions in environments which experience
extreme heat. We investigated how foraging behavior is influenced by environmental
temperature and life history characteristics, and how internal temperature is influenced by
foraging behavior and environmental temperature. We monitored black-body environmental
temperature and internal temperature with temperature-logging vaginal implant transmitters
while conducting a cafeteria-style diet study using captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus; hereafter: “deer”). From April through September 2022, we monitored intake and
diet selection of 35 individuals offered two diets with varying levels of protein and energy. We
used generalized linear mixed models to test the effect of reproductive status, age, sex, and
environmental temperature on daily intake levels and diet selection. We used linear mixed
effects models to evaluate the effect of daily intake, diet selection, and environmental
temperature on internal temperature. Deer selected diets with high energy and low protein
during gestation and post-parturition, antler growth, and juvenile body growth. Additionally, we
observed as environmental temperatures increased, deer reduced overall intake, reduced
protein intake, and increased energy intake. Lastly, we found internal temperature increased as
protein intake increased, revealing a physiological cost to consuming a high-protein diet. Our
results suggest foraging behavior can be strongly influenced by environmental conditions and
induces important physiologic responses in environments prone to extreme heat.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1
16,Behavioral state-specific resource selection of pronghorn in the Texas Panhandle,"Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are a grassland specialist species that have
experienced population declines and range contractions in portions of their distribution as a
result of anthropogenic development and loss of native vegetation communities. Understanding
how pronghorn select resources while in different behavioral states can reveal habitat
requirements for important but infrequent behaviors. We used hidden Markov modeling to
estimate behavioral states—encamped, foraging, and transiting—underlying movement of 72
pronghorn (36 males, 36 females) collared from 2017 – 2019 in the Texas Panhandle. We then
conducted step selection analyses to evaluate behavioral state-specific resource selection for
slope, distance to road, and distance to three landcover types—herbaceous vegetation, woody
vegetation, and cropland. Resource selection differed by behavioral state. Pronghorn spent the
most time foraging (65%), and selected areas with shallower slopes farther from roads and
woody vegetation. Foraging pronghorn exhibited seasonal variation in selection for herbaceous
vegetation, specifically selecting areas closer to herbaceous vegetation during the growing
season and farther from herbaceous vegetation during the dormant season. Pronghorn spent
the least amount of time encamped (10%), and resource selection generally aligned with
selection patterns when foraging. However, when transiting (25%), pronghorn selected areas
closer to roads and exhibited seasonal variation in selection for herbaceous vegetation. Our
findings provide insight into how rangeland composition and configuration influence resource
selection differentially when accounting for pronghorn behavior. Moreover, we highlight that
integrating behavioral modes into resource selection can identify critical habitat associations
that may be less prevalent but biologically important.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1
17,Behavioral State Specific Habitat Selection of Elk in the Trans-Pecos,"Little is known about elk (Cervus canadensis) populations in the Trans-Pecos region
of Texas. Population estimates suggests there could be approximately 3,500 free-ranging
individuals. However, there is minimal information on the dynamics of these populations. These
knowledge gaps have come into sharp focus with increased concern for chronic wasting
disease (CWD) in the Trans-Pecos. Thus, it is essential to understand the epidemiology of CWD
such as space use and drivers of movement in CWD susceptible species such as elk. Pilot data
collected from the first three GPS-collared elk in the Trans-Pecos (captured March 2023)
showed itinerant movement patterns. This instable space use has substantial implications for
disease spread. To further investigate this issue, we used Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to
segment the movement path into encamped and roaming states, then evaluated environmental
drivers of movement in each state using integrated step-selection functions (iSSFs). We found
clear signatures of encamped and roaming behaviors in elk movement patterns, with increased
probability of encampment near stream beds with green vegetation. Our iSSF analysis revealed
that elk movement routes were influenced by topography and shrub cover. Our top model found
that elk in the roaming state selected for landscape concavity (TPI; β = -0.754, SE = 0.0576),
avoided rugged terrain (β = -0.495, SE = 0.4572) and a quadratic term suggested preferred
elevation between 1200m to 1700m.This study provides a method for elk movement pattern
predictions and a basis for future studies to provide insight to CWD transmission pathways in
this understudied population.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1
18,White-tailed Deer Spatial Response to Temporary Bait During Camera Surveys,"Researchers commonly estimate white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)
abundance using bait to attract deer to camera stations. Our objective was to quantify whether
bait (i.e., whole kernel corn) presence and removal impacted home ranges (i.e., size and
overlap) and movement of deer during camera surveys. We conducted our research at Joint
Base San Antonio-Camp Bullis in central Texas from 2012 to 2013. We captured and fitted 64
deer (32 male, 32 female) with GPS collars, which collected 1 GPS location every 15 minutes
from 22 July to 2 September 2012¬–2013. Baited camera surveys were conducted from 5 to 18
of August annually. We evaluated the effect of bait on diurnal and nocturnal daily range size and
overlap of deer using spatial temporal analysis of moving polygons (STAMP). During the bait
period at night, male daily range size (149 ha) was 12% larger than pre-bait (133 ha). During the
bait period, male daily diurnal range overlap (0.15) was 26% lower compared to pre-bait period
(0.20). For females, daily nocturnal range size increased by 21% and overlap decreased by
13% from the pre-bait to bait. Daily distance moved (m) was similar (<6% difference) between
the bait and pre-bait period for both sexes. The presence and removal of bait had minimal
influence on deer space use. Our results suggest that using bait during camera surveys will
have minimal impact on deer daily range characteristics and movement.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1
19,Ranking and Prioritizing Species for Conservation and Research,"The Nongame & Rare Species program (NRSP) at Texas Parks & Wildlife conducts
research and management on a wide diversity of species. With over 70,000 nongame species in
the state, selecting the right species and research questions to focus on is crucial for making
meaningful conservation progress with limited resources. Over the past several years, the
NRSP has worked to develop new, objective criteria for determining which species are listed as
Species of Greatest Conservation Need and which qualify as State Threatened. The program
has also developed a novel strategy for identifying key knowledge gaps that need to be filled for
conservation measures to begin and developed a strategy for determining most crucial
conservation actions needed to recover imperiled species. In this presentation, we will explore
the inner workings of how TPWD rare species biologists are changing how they approach the
complex task of species conservation and recovery.",oral,Non-Game and Rare Species Conservation from TPWD
20,Collaborative programs that connect landowners and agencies to do conservation for federally listed and candidate species on private lands,"When the Endangered Species Act was passed by the U.S. Congress 50 years ago,
some viewed the act primarily as a regulatory mechanism, and thus, perceived that interaction
with agencies was best to be avoided. In response to this concern, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service created several programs that encourage and reward voluntary collaboration and
conservation on private lands. Specifically, maintaining or creating populations or habitat for
species that are listed as endangered or threatened, or are a candidate for listing, can come
with assurances for a landowner. Assurances can include authorizing some level of incidental
take and a commitment to ‘no surprises’ for the landowner should changes to the status or
regulations occur for a covered species. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has also
developed several programmatic agreements that streamline the process for landowners who
want to engage in voluntary conservation for federally listed and candidate species on their
lands. This presentation will explore current programs that facilitate voluntary conservation
actions for listed or candidate species, such as Habitat Conservation Plans, Safe Harbor
Agreements, and Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances. We will cover the
features and best applications for each program, as well as provide several examples of current
and ongoing initiatives. The goal of this presentation is to provide landowners, and those who
work with landowners, with a stronger understanding of the tools available for the conservation
of listed and candidate species on their working lands while also facilitating the continuation of
normal operations such as farming, ranching, and recreation.",oral,Non-Game and Rare Species Conservation from TPWD
21,Non-game Mammal Conservation in Texas,"Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) is charged with ensuring “the
continued ability of nongame species of fish and wildlife to perpetuate themselves successfully”.
As such, the TPWD Mammal Conservation Program focuses on the conservation, research, and
management of the non-game mammals and furbearers in Texas. The program covers a wide
variety of mammal species, with most attention on those that are federal or state threatened and
endangered as well as species of greatest conservation need (SGCN), such as Texas kangaroo
rats (Dipodomys elator), black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), Davis mountains
cottontails (Sylvilagus robustus), plains spotted skunks (Spilogale interrupta), swift foxes
(Vulpes velox), ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), black bears (Ursus americanus), and mountain
lions (Puma concolor). Bats were recently split into their own program due to their unique needs
and threats. In this presentation, we will discuss the current efforts underway for the mammals

species. Thus, the ways in which the program works to meet the ultimate goal of supporting
sustainable populations of non-game mammals in the state will be examined.",oral,Non-Game and Rare Species Conservation from TPWD
22,Use of Electric Fencing to Deter Bears from Attractants in an Arid Landscape,"Black bears were extirpated from the Trans-Pecos region of Texas by the 1950s but
began recolonizing the region from northern Mexico in the 1980s.  This recolonization has led to
increasing incidents of human-bear conflict.  The prevalence of deer feeders on the Texas
landscape creates a unique challenge because of the increased opportunity for human-bear
conflict.  Two types of deer feeders are common in Texas, free choice deer pellet feeders and
spin-cast feeders.  Since 2018, Texas Parks and Wildlife staff have been testing the use of
electricity to deter bears from feeders.  Systems that utilized an earthen ground return for the
negative circuit were ineffective in the arid environment despite attempts to improve the
grounding system.  Using livestock panels to create a metal apron laid in front of an electric
fence or underneath an electrified spin-cast feeder for the negative circuit have proven effective.
A 7-wire all hot fence (~34 inches tall) with a metal grounding apron successfully deterred bears
using energizers rated at 0.15-0.25 output joules.  Likewise, electrified spin-cast feeders with a
metal grounding apron successfully prevented feeder damage using energizers rated at 0.08-
0.20 output joules.  A third design entailed adding a single hot wire positioned 2-3 inches above
and 2-3 inches inside of an existing hog panel or netwire fence.  Using 0.15-0.25 output joule
energizers, this design successfully deterred as well.   We discuss the efficacy of these designs
in securing various black bear attractants in the Trans-Pecos region and other arid landscapes.",oral,Non-Game and Rare Species Conservation from TPWD
23,Historical Changes in The Distribution of Montezuma Quail In Texas (1850-1950),"Understanding the history of a species’ geographical range is fundamental to
establishing context for its present condition and developing realistic approaches to its
management and conservation. Unfortunately, there is very little documented information in the
published literature about the historical Texas distribution of Montezuma Quail (Cyrtonyx
montezumae) a Species of Greatest Conservation Need. Generally, published depictions of
Montezuma Quail distributions are without documentation. I addressed this problem by
assembling a database of dated and geo-referenced voucher specimens (n = 54) and
occurrence records (n = 136) of Montezuma Quail to assess spatial and temporal patterns of
Texas distributions through historical time (1850-1950). Historical records revealed that in 1850
Montezuma Quail occupied a large and diverse landscape encompassing 125,745 km2 across
8 distinct macro-scale terrain-vegetation frameworks. The Texas distribution consisted of 2
units—a mostly contiguous central Texas unit centered on the Edwards Plateau and a highly
fragmented Trans-Pecos unit associated with plateaus, cuestas, and rugged desert mountain
ranges with ≥1,400 m elevation. The 1850 central Texas and Trans-Pecos distributions covered
an estimated 109,320 km2 and 16,425 km2, respectively. Beginning in the 1880s, the central
Texas distribution underwent a rapid and dramatic contraction that reduced its former expansive
range to 2,399 km2. By the 1930s, Montezuma Quail were reduced to relict populations in parts
of several counties along the western end of the southern Balcones Escarpment. In contrast,
the Trans-Pecos distribution of Montezuma Quail remained essentially unchanged over the
historical period, being extirpated from the Franklin Mountains and possibly some marginal, low
elevation areas. The records-based data presented in this paper provide firm evidence of the
former robustness and subsequent plight of Montezuma Quail in Texas. I propose that
Montezuma Quail need greater conservation effort and give broad recommendations for its
future management.",oral,Non-Game and Rare Species Conservation from TPWD
24,Monitoring and learning the urban ecosystem with iNaturalist,"The urban ecosystems in Texas are filled with biodiversity, and one of our challenges
as wildlife biologists and nature enthusiasts is to learn about the flora and fauna that make up
these cities and towns.  In many cases, the urban ecosystems are composed of native,
naturalized, and invasive species.  To manage these properly, it's important to learn the
identifications of all of the components of these areas.  One of the most powerful tools that we
can use is iNaturalist, a citizen science social network that uses both an automated species
identification and a community of naturalists to verify these identifications.  Not only does the
repetition of observing organisms add valuable data to our knowledge of global biodiversity, but
it also aids in the natural resource management of the area.  By using iNaturalist regularly, a
wildlife biologist and nature enthusiast can generate a substantial knowledge about the entire
ecosystem.  We will discuss the importance of using this tool and how to gain the most out of
regular use, especially in the urban ecosystem.",oral,Non-Game and Rare Species Conservation from TPWD
25,Responses of Riparian Vegetation Before and After Ashe Juniper Removal,"Woody encroachment of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) is an ongoing problem in
many Texas riparian areas. Studies on the responses of ecosystems to removal of Ashe juniper
indicate that the response could be specific to heavy disturbance. Our study occurs at a tract of
land undergoing restoration in north-central Texas in the Crosstimbers ecoregion (Palo Pinto
Mountain State Park; opens to public access 2024). Our objective is to examine the effect of
Ashe juniper removal and the subsequent disturbance on riparian vegetation for 3–5 years post-
removal. Restoration began in phases in 2020. A contracted company initiated mechanical
removal of Ashe juniper from multiple riparian areas. In 2022 we initiated reseeding efforts of
herbaceous ground cover following removal. In removal areas, we measure stem counts,
canopy cover, and herbaceous cover 1 year prior to removal and 3–5 years post-removal. Our
study is a before-after treatment design that we analyze using a two-way nested ANOVA.
Preliminary results from phase 1, 2 years post-removal and phase 2, 1-year post-removal
suggest slight trends towards wood vegetation recovery, but a potential delayed response by
the herbaceous cover due to an increase in litter coverage. In summer 2023, we collected
another year of post-treatment data, which will include results from our reseeding efforts. Our
results inform immediate restoration activities, such as the decision to initiate reseeding efforts
with removal of litter cover, and provide more understanding about community-level responses
to Ashe juniper removal.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management
26,Long-term Vegetation Dynamics on a Semi-arid Multiple-use Landscape,"Vegetation-environmental relationships are difficult to discriminate, as are drivers of
floral change. Multi-year monitoring of spatially congruent sites can ascertain the direction and
cause of floristic shifts. Our objective was to assess long-term vegetation change on a multiple
use military installation in eastern New Mexico using ground-sampling techniques. A modified
point-intercept method was used to obtain species frequency and foliar height data at 45 plots
across 6 sampling periods from 2008 to 2021. We used redundancy analysis and canonical
analysis of principal coordinates to assess gradients of floristic change and plot-level
spatiotemporal differences. Soil composition and annual microclimate were the drivers of
species presence and frequency (R2 = 0.41, p < 0.001), and plot-level analysis showed minimal
cyclic movement but no unidirectional shifts. Plot composition weakly differed across periods
with rainfall disparities but were similar between years with comparable microclimate (R = 0.09,
p < 0.0001). Plot composition moderately differed across maneuver areas (R = 0.36, p <
0.0001) but were not significantly different in maneuver areas with similar soils and land use.
Our results indicate that soil characteristics drive presence whereas annual weather patterns
influence prevalence, and no permanent state change has occurred across the 13-year time
span. Future monitoring efforts should focus on quantifying anthropogenic management
activities and their influence on composition shifts. Our study approach can assist land
managers using a variety of sampling metrics in assessing site-specific long-term changes in
vegetation composition and validate state-and-transition models currently used by land
management agencies.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management
27,Understanding Pollinator Preference and Resource Use for Water Conservation Plantings in North-Central Texas Landscapes,"Insect pollinators are declining across local and regional scales, with contributing
factors including urbanization, intensive agriculture, and climate change. Current climate models
suggest increased frequency and severity of drought events in North-Central Texas, which
reduces wild floral resources in areas that are already limited by other factors in the landscape.
Pollinator syndromes are thought to give a general idea of the types of flowers involved in
attracting different pollinators and are based on suites of floral cues and morphologies.
Biologists can improve the integrity of ecosystem services provided by pollinators by providing
environmentally robust floral resources in anthropogenic landscapes. Understanding pollinator
attractiveness to plants is crucial for providing quality floral resources in urban landscapes. The
purpose of our study is to understand pollinator preference and resource use associated with
drought-tolerant, commercially available landscape perennials and to determine the efficacy of
pollinator syndromes in North-Central Texas. We established 4, 8.5 x 14-m plots with 3, 2 x 14-
m rows containing 20 perennial plant taxa. We conducted weekly observations from May to
November 2022 and recorded pollinator visitors during 60 second observations at each plant.
Using bipartite network indices, we found evidence of preference by pollinator groups generally
consistent with traditional pollinator syndromes and identified commercially available landscape
perennials attractive to pollinator groups. Our findings recommend selecting plant species for
pollinator conservation in urban areas where water resources may be limited as well as
promoting a suite of robust flowering perennials for consideration in restoration or conservation
plantings.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management
28,The Power of Rocks: Ecohydrology Improvements for Habitat Restoration,"The decline of scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) populations has been mainly
attributed to habitat degradation. Increasing plant diversity and reducing soil erosion could help
alleviate habitat challenges. Therefore, we have deployed a holistic strategy to restore riparian
habitat within the Chihuahuan Desert by building structures known as “trincheras” (small rock
dams) to improve hydrological processes. We expect restoration efforts to increase water
harvest, reduce soil erosion, increase native vegetation, and positively affect soil cover and
retention. Restoration efforts began in August of 2021 in a private ranch in Southern Brewster
County. To date, we have built 130 trincheras. Of those, 50 have been assessed before and
after the rainy seasons of 2022 and 2023 to measure how much soil was retained. We used a
Functional Principal Component Analysis to determine how sediments accumulated where
trincheras were established. As a result, we found significant accumulation up to and beyond
2m upstream from trincheras. Also, we observed negligible loss of sediments downstream to a
distance of 0.5m from the trinchera. Variability in the capture of soil sediments may be related to
stream features like slope, soil type, and channel size. This study can guide placement and
expectations of ecohydrology improvements, leading to more effective habitat restoration. By
increasing soil deposition in riparian areas, trincheras are an effective tool to promote plant
production and ground cover in the short term.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management
29,A biologist’s review of ESRI field data collecting apps: selecting the best tool for your needs,"ESRI (maker of ArcGIS products) commands a large share of the GIS market and
has produced a variety of apps biologists can use for field data collection. However, it is
sometimes difficult to discern the nuances between apps and the license levels needed for
each. We discuss the pros/ cons of the following apps: Field Maps, Survey 123, and Quick
Capture. Field Maps is a map-centric app that excels at collecting points, lines and polygons
quickly, while offering a basemap for navigation. Survey 123 is form-centric, and best to use
when extensive amounts of data are being gathered on the fly at each location. Quick Capture
is a newer option with buttons to collect data quickly and on the fly with minimal user training
and input. We cover the current license levels offered by ESRI and explain what levels are
required for creation of maps to use in each app, and if additional licenses are required for data
collecting staff. All ESRI apps utilize on board GPS capabilities of the user’s device but are
improved with the use of an external Bluetooth connected GPS unit. After using all three apps in
the field, we believe that Survey 123 is the easiest for a beginner to design and use while still
offering versatility. Use of these data collection apps will streamline post processing and reduce
user error from mis-entered data. Understanding the options available and the costs required
will allow biologists to choose the best setup for their projects and budget.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management
30,Updates and Advancements for Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas,"Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas (EMSTX) consist of a 411 class, land
classification map for Texas. Each EMSTX type is uniquely identified based on vegetation
community and landcover.  As well as, geological influences, landforms, and soil type. Land
cover is determined from photo interpretation of satellite imagery in addition to species-specific,
ground-collected plot data to distinguish between herbaceous, shrubland, and woodland/forest
types. Ground data collection consists primarily of roadside plots where % cover and dominant
species are recorded for trees, shrubs, and herbaceous cover. To further improve EMSTX
mapping accuracy, geophysical settings using soil Map Units from the gSSURGO data and
LIDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) were introduced. Using 10-meter imagery, rules
for the classification of each EMS type followed the format: land cover + abiotic factors =
mapped EMS type. In 2014, more than 12,000 spatially specific, ground samples were obtained
in support of previous mapping efforts (85% accuracy) and system descriptions. With new
efforts already underway, significant improvements are evident in both spatial and thematic
resolution, including the high resolution mapping of canyons, mapping forest classes based on
height, and assessing fine-scale grassland quality on a regional level. With numerous
applications for a statewide update to this dataset, the implications for both TPWD and partners
include an improved tool for improved land stewardship, landscape change detection, as well as
conservation planning and management efforts.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management
31,Habitat Loss and the Behavioral Effects on a Female Gray Hawk in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas,"Habitat loss is a major threat to wildlife worldwide. Though we typically associate
habitat loss with the degradation of large tracts of suitable space, habitat loss in urban
environments can be much more incremental. We tracked an adult female Gray Hawk (Buteo
plagiatus) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas before and after 70% of the trees (7.6 ha)
were cleared from her core breeding territory and used a hidden Markov model to infer two
behavioral states from her movements. While her overall activity budget between within-patch
and exploratory movements was unchanged, she undertook substantially longer exploratory
movements after the clearcut. These longer movements likely resulted in higher energetic costs
and exposed her to additional anthropogenic threats, such as roads. Road exposure within her
territory increased from 7 km to 547 km following the clearcut.  Preserving natural areas and
enhancing wildlife-friendly features in urban green spaces could facilitate adaptation of species
like the Gray Hawk to increasingly urban environments. Our study highlights the behavioral
effects of seemingly minor habitat loss on a highly mobile predator; however, impacts could be
far more severe in species with limited mobility.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2
32,Escape Cover Use by Multiple Quail Species in Response to Raptor Predation,"Habitat management is important for conservation of quail, but predator-specific
escape cover use is poorly understood. To better understand this habitat requirement, I
collected escape cover use data for Gambel’s (Callipepla gambelii), scaled (Callipepla
squamata), and Montezuma (Cyrtonyx montezumae) quail pursued by trained falconry hawks
during 171 hunting trials in winter 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 in Arizona and New Mexico.
Gambel’s quail and scaled quail used middens (21.3% and 27.6%, respectively) and
rabbit/squirrel holes (14.9% and 12.1%, respectively) for escape similarly. Middens and holes
were usually associated with woody shrubs and cactus. Woody shrub cover, however, was the
primary escape cover by Gambel’s (53.2%) and scaled (29.3) quail and additional holes may
have been undetected. Grass was the only escape cover used by Montezuma quail (100%). My
data suggests middens and holes are used by Gambel’s and scaled quail in 36.2 – 39.7% of
successful escapes from raptor predation, but where not used by Montezuma quail. Although
untested so far, falconers believe that the same middens and holes are used repeatedly across
the season, suggesting quail know where the safe escape covers are within their activity areas.
This suggests that midden building rodents and hole burrowing mammals, and the features they
construct, are important to consider in a community context when managing for quail habitat.
Additional data are being collected for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) during November
2023 – January 2024 and will be included in the final results.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2
33,Changes in Avian Community Structure Following Prescribed Thinning of Pinyon- Juniper Woodlands in New Mexico,"Pinyon-juniper woodlands are a vital vegetation community for ecosystem health and
biodiversity throughout the western United States. However, woodland stand characteristics
have been impacted by historical grazing practices, fire suppression, and climate change,
facilitating woody encroachment into landscapes that were predominantly open grassland
savannas. In response, large-scale thinning and prescribed burning efforts are underway to
restore stand densities and patterns while reducing hazardous fuel loads. However, these
efforts must consider potential impacts to both pinyon-juniper obligate and grassland-nesting
birds. To develop a better scientific understanding of how avian communities change following
common woodland thinning approaches, we have partnered with the US Fish and Wildlife
Service and Bureau of Land Management to conduct a long-term avian monitoring study in
Lincoln County, New Mexico. We stratified random sampling across gradients of thinning
intensities and utilized detection probability survey methods during 2018-2023 to assess
changes over time in woodland bird communities associated with specific thinning treatments.
This ongoing collaboration aims to provide key insights into species-specific and ecological
community responses to woodland thinning. Ultimately, this research will provide data to
facilitate informed policies and management decisions focused on balancing ecological
restoration of pinyon-juniper ecosystems with avian conservation priorities on public forest
lands.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2
34,Productivity and Nest Survival of White-Tailed Hawks in South Texas During the 2021-2023 Breeding Season,"The white-tailed hawk (Geranoaetus albicaudatus) is a neotropical bird of prey with a
restricted breeding range concentrated in the coastal bend region of Texas. Population
estimates and demographics are largely unknown, which pushes the state-threatened listing of
this species. Previous estimates of white-tailed hawk nesting success show high spatial and
latitudinal variability. More investigation of their breeding ecology and nest success throughout
the Gulf Coast of Texas is necessary to expand our current understanding of productivity and
inform conservation planning for the species. We observed 80% breeding success from
monitoring 40 different white-tailed hawk nests along the coast in south Texas during the 2021
and 2022 breeding seasons. From 40 adult pairs, 0.677 nestlings were produced per breeding
attempt, and 0.581 nestlings survived to fledge per breeding attempt. We found that the
estimated daily survival rate probability increased in relation to nest height (mean = 3.54 m).
The daily nest survival estimate for all nests pooled was 0.9969 (95% CI = 0.9898– 0.9990),
which translates to an estimated nest survival of 77.8%. These results are at the high end of
previously reported estimates. This could be attributed to the broad spatial distribution of our
sample that may conceal any localized patterns of nesting failure, or to the temporal period in
which we collected data compared to studies conducted previously. Data collection regarding
nest survival is ongoing for the 2023 breeding season. Future analyses will investigate potential
variation in nest survival, incorporating environmental factors and latitude.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2
35,American Kestrel Nest Survival and Productivity Across a Decade in the Southern High Plains of Texas,"American kestrel (Falco sparverius) populations are declining across much of North
America and it is a species of increasing conservation concern. One region in which the species
appears stable is in the shortgrass prairie of the Southern High Plains. In this region, we have
monitored occupancy and reproduction of American Kestrels in a nest box program from 2014 –
2023 in Lubbock County TX. Among 32 initial nest boxes, we observed an occupancy increase
from 12% during the first year of the nest box program to as much as 73% in subsequent years.
From 2014 – 2022 (data for 2023 is pending for analysis and inclusion) we monitored 158
known fate nest attempts. Observed nest success from 2014 – 2022 averaged 79%, but the
modeled daily survival rate averaged 0.9954 (range = 0.9911 to 0.9979), with modelled nest
survival averaging 76.5% (± 8.3). Across 10 breeding seasons, average clutch size was 4.6
eggs (± 0.32), with 3.8 (± 0.41) nestlings per hatched clutch, and 3.3 (± 0.51) fledglings per
successful nest; 391 fledglings were produced during the 2014 – 2022 study period. Kestrel
populations across the nation that use artificial cavities are experiencing nest success rates of
49 – 73%. Our population has high nest success which might be due to suspected site- and
pair-fidelity and the nesting experience of pairs, favorable climate, and extended breeding
season. We will include 2023 data for a final analysis of productivity and examination of multiple
covariates to better assess daily nest survival.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2
36,An Experimental Investigation of the Influence of Green Plant Material in Raptor Nest Microclimate,"Many raptor species place green plant material on their nests during incubation and
nestling rearing periods. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this behavior; the
generally accepted, but unconfirmed, explanation is that greenery functions as a repellent to
ectoparasites. We examined the alternative hypothesis that fresh greenery may meaningfully
modify the microclimate of raptor nests. Our study species was the Mississippi Kite (Ictinia
mississippiensis). We predicted that addition of fresh greenery would 1) increase humidity at
nests, 2) decrease temperature at nests, 3) provisioning of greenery would be correlated to
periods of low humidity and high temperature, and 4) tree species used for greenery would
release more moisture per unit volume compared to species not used. We created 25 simulated
Mississippi Kite nests within a controlled environment. 5 were control nests, and we added
treatments consisting of 4 local tree species to 5 nests each, monitoring the temperature and
humidity levels over 17 hours. Running a Hedges test with the collected data demonstrated a
significant difference in temperature and humidity levels within the treatment nests, with all
treatments having periods of g>1.0. A changing climate is resulting in increasing aridity and
temperatures, especially in already arid regions. Low humidity and high temperature have been
demonstrated to reduce nest success of raptors. We have demonstrated that addition of as little
as 5 g of greenery can have meaningful influences on nest microclimate. This provides insight
into a behavior that could contribute to species longevity, even with a changing climate.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2
37,Monitoring Changes in Northern Bobwhite Density over 10 years within a Large- scale Experimental Grazing Study in South Texas,"In South Texas, northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) occur on lands where
grazing and hunting are integral to the ranch’s viability and longevity. Identifying a causal
relationship between cattle grazing and bobwhite density requires consideration of precipitation,
range productivity, management type, and historical land use, among other variables. In 2014, a
large-scale monitoring project was developed on an East Foundation ranch in Jim Hogg County,
TX, to observe annual bobwhite density over a 7,505-ha grazing treatment area. Prior to 2014,
the area was heavily grazed by cattle. Grazing was removed from 2014–2015. From January
2016 to May 2018, grazing was applied at one of two fixed stock densities within management
units, either continuously (n = 4 management units) or rotationally (n = 6 units). In 2018, cattle
were removed due to extreme drought. Grazing was deferred from May 2018 through October",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 3
38,Predicted Habitat Overlap Between Montezuma Quail and Feral Pigs in the Davis Mountains of West Texas,"Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are highly intelligent, adaptive ecological generalists that
affect many ecosystems through rooting. This foraging behavior disturbs the soil, which
potentially reduces plant cover, alters soil composition, and ultimately causes nutrient loss and
altered vegetation communities that other native species depend upon. There is concern about
the damage to sensitive ecosystems that occur predominantly in the sky islands of West Texas.
Sky islands generate topographically diverse habitats that occur along an elevational-climatic
gradient that many species thrive in, including the Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae) in
the Davis Mountains (Jeff Davis Co.). Across their range, overgrazing has been identified as
one of the biggest contributing factors to population decline due to loss of ground cover and
reduced forage availability. We fit a beta regression model, from collected presence data, to
predict presence of feral pigs across the entire range of the Davis Mountains. Once we created
a raster of predicted feral pig presence, we were able to calculate a predicted overlap of 51% for
feral pig presence and predicted Montezuma quail habitat in the Davis Mountains (Sauer 2018).
Feral pig presence doesn’t completely overlap with predicted Montezuma quail habitat but
occurs in areas that are considered critical for Montezuma quail when their populations are low
and resources are scarce. This opens the door to question if feral pigs might have an effect on
Montezuma quail resources and habitats.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 3
39,"Winter Habitat Selection and Movement Behavior of Scaled Quail in the Trans- Pecos, Texas","Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) have experienced population declines in the last
several decades, primarily attributed to habitat degradation. Changes in habitat composition
compound seasonal reductions in resources, such as those occurring during winter. In the
Trans-Pecos region, winter presents scaled quail with reduced food and cover availability. As
these factors can prompt behavioral responses to resultant changes in habitat quality,
monitoring spatial behaviors can lend insight into how scaled quail respond to winter conditions.
We hypothesize that scaled quail will use supplemental resources and select for hydrologic
features that offer greater availability of food, cover and thermal refuge. We trapped scaled quail
in southern Brewster County, Texas during winter 2022-2023 using walk-in funnel traps and fit
them with Global Positioning System (GPS) backpacks to obtain winter location data. We
captured 314 scaled quail during the study period and deployed GPS backpacks on 37 scaled
quail (22 Female, 15 Male). We modelled scaled quail habitat selection and movement using
integrated Step Selection Analysis. Covariates included distance to quail feeders, Topographic
Position Index (TPI), monthly Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), and the effect
of ambient temperature on step length and selection of hydrologic features. We explored
interindividual variation in selection behaviors using Principal Component Analysis of selection
coefficients generated from step selection functions. Results from this study will provide novel

40,Genetic Structure and Variation of Wild Turkey in Oklahoma,"Global change due to anthropogenic pressures has led to biodiversity loss and shifts
in wildlife population dynamics.  These pressures have led to habitat loss, species declines, and
alterations in population structure.  These ecological and environmental changes are notably
occurring within the Great Plains, USA biome, where state transitions driven by altered
ecological processes are restructuring biological communities.  For instance, wild turkey
(Meleagris gallopavo) populations within this biome have exhibited range-wide population
declines because of habitat loss and fragmentation.  Population decline and reduced
connectivity may severely affect population structure.  Furthermore, environmental change may
prompt fluctuations in structure and geographic distribution among subspecies, influencing
levels of hybridization and introgression.  Finally, active management, such as translocations,
has had uneven success in restoration of populations.  In this study, we will assess the genetic
diversity and differentiation of wild turkey populations across Oklahoma and evaluate the extent
of hybridization between subspecies and the influence of translocations on population structure.
We collected tissue samples from hunter-harvested birds statewide during 2022 and 2023 and
generated low-coverage (18x) whole-genome sequence data for 160 individuals from 52
counties.  Analysis of genomic data will illustrate current statewide population structure as well
as examine the relationship between Rio Grande and Eastern subspecies.  Assessments of
genomic diversity will provide further inspection of genetic composition and differentiation within

41,Landscape Assessment of Wild Turkey Roosting Habitat and Change in the Texas Rolling Plains,"Rio Grande wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) populations in the Rolling
Plains of Texas have remained depressed following drought that lasted from 2010 to 2014.
Across most semi-arid rangelands, Rio Grande wild turkey distribution is strongly dependent on
the availability of roosting habitat. Thus, loss or alteration of roosting habitat is an increasing
concern during the last decade due to its potential impacts on wild turkeys in the Rolling Plains.
Our goal was to assess the changes in land use and cover and identify the habitat
characteristics that drive roost site selection of wild turkeys across Bird Conservation Region 19
(BCR 19). We used satellite imagery and ground control points to assess landscape change
from 2004 to 2021. Furthermore, we used roost site location data obtained from 3 empirical
datasets across BCR 19 and random forest models to predict roost site habitat across the
region. Our results indicated that tree cover increased by almost 20% from 2004 to 2021, while
invasive tree cover decreased throughout this period by 22.2-47.2%. Our roost site selection
model, using data from 2017 to 2018, indicated that turkeys selected roost sites with >4% tree
cover and exclusively within flood plains. Additionally, turkeys selected roost sites with 40-60%
perennial forb and grass cover and 15-30% woody shrub cover. Our results provide valuable
insight into roost site selection characteristics for wild turkeys. Future efforts will link landscape
change to roosting habitat amount and distribution to better understand how roost site
availability may impact wild turkey populations.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 3
42,Seasonality of Competition Potential Between Desert Bighorn and Mule Deer on Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area,"Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area (EMWMA) serves as a nursery herd
for ongoing desert bighorn (Ovis canadensis) restoration efforts. Consequently, the primary
management objective is production of surplus animals for use as source stock for
translocation. However, EMWMA also provides public hunting opportunities, particularly for
mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Thus, maintaining a healthy mule deer population is also a
key management goal on EMWMA. The area is unique in the high degree of spatial overlap
between the two species, presumably leading to competition for resources. However, seasonal
shifts in space use by each species may exacerbate or curtail competition. Our goal was to
identify potential seasonality in both space use and resource competition between species. In
March 2023, we deployed Global Positioning System collars on 30 bighorn sheep and 24 mule
deer to investigate temporal patterns of space use. We fit monthly Brownian bridge utilization
distributions (UDs) to the movement path of each individual, then combined them to produce
monthly UDs at the species level. We then measured overlap between species each month
using Bhattacharya’s Affinity (BA). Finally, we modeled seasonality of overlap between groups
with periodic beta regression models. We found evidence of seasonality in spatial overlap, with
maximum overlap during July (BA = 0.59) and minimum overlap during October (BA = 0.40).
Our results suggest seasonality of bighorn space use is driven by social behaviors (e.g. rut), but
may mitigate potential for resource competition with mule deer at EMWMA.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2
43,Survival and recruitment of white-tailed deer fawns in South Texas,"In large mammals, recruitment is a significant determinant of population growth and
influenced by environmental stochasticity, yet the drivers are poorly understood. In white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), fawn survival is typically the most dynamic parameter influencing
variation in recruitment and understanding drivers of survival is important for managing
populations. We studied survival and cause-specific mortality of fawns in a deer population not
exposed to predator control, supplemental feed, or harvest on the East Foundation’s San
Antonio Viejo Ranch in South Texas, USA. We captured and radio-collared white-tailed deer
fawns at birth by monitoring pregnant adult females equipped with vaginal implant transmitters,
and at approximately 4-months and 8-months-old via aerial net-gunning during 2020-2023. We
captured 222 fawns and monitored individuals until death or loss of collar. We determined cause
of death using molecular and observational field evidence. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 12-week
survival across the 4 years ranged from 30-35%, and 1-year survival ranged from 12-24%.
Coyotes (Canis latrans) were the primary cause of mortality, accounting for almost half of the
documented mortalities, but bobcats (Lynx rufus) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa) also killed fawns. In
southern Texas, coyotes are suggested as the most dominant predator of fawns. Most mortality
events occurred during the first 5 weeks of life and during late winter (February-March). The
high winter mortality was unexpected but coincided with poor range conditions and extreme
temperatures. Our low fawn survival estimates suggest annual survival of adult female deer
must be high to sustain populations on southern Texas rangelands.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2
44,Assessing Temporal Space Use Stability in the Trans-Pecos Black Bear Population,"The recolonizing west Texas black bear (Ursus americanus) population has
increased over the last 25 years, with a dramatic increase in the past 5 years, posing new
challenges to managers and residents. Monitoring the abundance and distribution of
recolonizing black bears is essential to understand the progression of recolonization and inform
potential areas of human-bear conflict. Most abundance estimators assume a closed population,
which is difficult to satisfy when a population is expanding its range and navigating stochastic
environmental patterns in this unique desert environment. However, because bear behavior is
highly seasonal, appropriate timing of sampling may satisfy the closure assumption. We
examined temporal patterns of space use stability (SUS) among 21 GPS-collared black bears
(6F, 15M) in the Trans-Pecos starting Oct 2022. We generated comparative metrics between
successive weekly Brownian bridge utilization distributions for each individual, including
Pianka's niche overlap ( x̅ = 0.19, SD = 0.26), peak to peak distance ( x̅ = 66.19 km, SD = 115.37
km), and 95% isopleth area ( x̅ = 77021.25 km2, SD = 98771.78 km2). We used ~600 records in
a 2-state hidden Markov model to delineate periods of high and low SUS. While temporal
patterns were evident, bear space use was highly unstable in this population. The proportion of
bears in the stable state was highest from mid-December to mid-May; therefore, population
closure may be a tenable assumption during this time. These results will aid management in
planning accurate population monitoring and will provide a better understanding of patterns in
bear recolonization.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2
45,Fine-scale behavioral patterns of newly recolonizing black bears in West Texas,"Black bears (Ursus americanus) began recolonizing West Texas in the late 1980s
after being extirpated from the state in the 1950s. Despite their protected status, little is known
about this population or the rate and extent of recolonization, and information on their behavioral
patterns is severely lacking. To that end, we collared 20 bears with GPS collars programmed
with 2-hour fix rates. Using hidden Markov models (HMMs) we segmented the movement paths
of 19 bears (13 M, 6 F) into 4 behavioral states based on probability distributions of step lengths
(SL), turning angles, residence times, and revisitation rates. Two states reflected dispersive
movement behaviors ( x̅SL = 245.31 ± 7.03 (SE), 1054.81 ± 53.33) and two states reflected
localized movement behaviors ( x̅SL = 12.87 ± 0.63, 3.88 ± 0.14). The probabilities of remaining
in both dispersive movement states were higher (77% ± 0.01, 71% ± 0.02) than remaining in
either localized movement state (51% ± 0.03, 52% ± 0.02). We then examined the influence of
environmental covariates on the transition probabilities between states to investigate which
abiotic and biotic factors influence where bears make specific behavioral decisions.
Understanding drivers behind bear behaviors can improve our ability to predict future behaviors
in novel environments as they continue their recolonization and allow us to predict future conflict
areas. Additionally, understanding habitat characteristics associated with these behavioral
processes will be crucial for identifying key areas in need of protection for long-term population
viability.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2
46,Fire as a driver of bobcat occupancy in East Texas,"Prescribed fire is an important tool in forest management that reduces fuel loads,
maintains historical disturbance regimes, alters vegetation structure, and influences wildlife
communities. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are the largest obligate carnivore in many fire-dependent
forested ecosystems in the southeastern USA and therefore are an ideal species to assess the
effects of fire on wildlife communities. To examine the influence of fire on bobcat occupancy in a
frequently burned ecosystem, we deployed 40 remote cameras on the Boggy Slough
Conservation Area in eastern Texas. We collected occurrence data from July to September
2023 and linked these data to landcover and fire history within a 500 m buffer around each
camera site. We used fire records from 2015-2023 to calculate the time since most recent fire,
mean fire return interval, number of fires, and proportion of area burned. Landcover was
categorized as natural pine, planted pine, hardwood forest, or open. We fit occupancy models
using landcover and fire history covariates and compared models using AICc. Bobcat
occupancy was best predicted by fire history and the probability of occupancy increased with
the proportion of area burned (p=0.05). The probability of detection was greatest in natural pine
suggesting bobcats may be more active in this cover type. As an apex predator in our system,
bobcat occupancy can be used as an indicator of the response to forest management by wildlife
species across trophic levels. Our results suggest prescribed fire created forest conditions that
improved habitat quality for bobcats.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2
47,Understanding the Diet of an Unmanaged Population of Coyotes in Southern Texas,"Understanding the diet of a species is crucial for effective wildlife management.
Predator selection of prey items can strongly influence the population dynamics and food
availability of other wildlife. One such species is the coyote (Canis latrans), whose great dietary
plasticity can variably impact other species. With increasing urbanization and changes in land
use nationwide, researchers focus on evaluating coyote diet within these contexts. However,
understanding coyote diet in a large-scale wildland with a lack of human intervention can
provide insight into management on similar properties. Our study aimed to evaluate the diet of a
coyote population in southern Texas where no native wildlife is managed by harvesting,
trapping, or supplemental feeding and compare it to previous studies involving human
intervention. We collected coyote scat from 20 one kilometer transects on the roads of the East
Foundation's San Antonio Viejo Ranch every month of 2021. Prey items were morphologically
analyzed using relative volume based on a grid system. Overall, we identified 22 unique species
with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and feral pig (Sus scrofa) being the most
consumed with a dietary shift to vegetation in the fall months. The high proportion of ungulates
consumed year long as opposed to high proportions of lagomorphs and rodents shows a
distinguishing difference of this study. Further research may be conducted to identify the
influence of this population’s diet, among of which could be high coyote density, high preferred
prey density, and changes in coyote behavioral activity as well as in their age structures.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2
48,Monitoring highway mitigation structures for ocelots and bobcats,"Roads can have significant impacts on wildlife, including on bobcats (Lynx rufus) and
ocelots (Leopardus pardalis). In the United States, the ocelot is an endangered species with
vehicle collisions as the leading known cause of mortality. Therefore, road mitigation for ocelots
is critically important to conservation of ocelots in the United States. In South Texas, road
mitigation structures for ocelots, including wildlife crossings are being constructed for ocelot
conservation. As part of this effort, monitoring felid populations pre-, during-, and post-
construction of these mitigation structures is critical to assessing their effectiveness and
determining road impacts on ocelots. Ocelots, however, are rare on the landscape so bobcats
are used as surrogate species to understand ecological impacts of roads on ocelots. We are
monitoring bobcat and ocelot populations around US Highway 77 in Willacy and Kenedy
Counties with camera traps, GPS collars, and wildlife road mortality surveys to understand how
construction of road mitigation structures for wildlife impact habitat use of road areas, including
wildlife crossings by bobcats and ocelots. One wildlife crossing is complete on US 77 and nine
more will be constructed over the next 10 years. We have documented high populations of and
regular wildlife crossing use by bobcats living in the area. We are recording interactions of
bobcats with this wildlife crossing considering 4 different behaviors: full crossing, entry/exit,
approach, and in the area. This work will help the Texas Department of Transportation improve
designs of road mitigation for wildlife and help support ocelot conservation efforts throughout
Texas.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3
49,Development of an Improved Survey Method for the Texas Kangaroo Rat,"The Texas kangaroo rat (Dipodomys elator) currently inhabits five counties in
Texas. Habitat fragmentation and changing vegetation patterns are believed to be responsible
for the reduction of the population such that it is currently a state threatened species under
petition for federal protection. The species rarity and nocturnal activity periods result in them
being difficult to survey, monitor, and study. We tested different approaches to develop a
repeatable and reliable survey method for these elusive animals. We used the more abundant
Ord’s kangaroo rat (D. ordii) as a proxy for Texas kangaroo rats due to the species similarity.
Our survey trials were conducted on transects set along roads, two-tracks, and in open fields.
On roads we tested driving with headlights and spotlights, and walking surveys using spotlights
or thermal scopes. On two-tracks and open fields we tested using spotlights and thermals
scopes. We also conducted burrow surveys as an indirect measure of kangaroo rats. We are
assessing the different methods on basis of detection probabilities with covariates of moon
phase, time, temperature, and cloud cover. Our results should provide guidance to optimize
survey methods for Texas kangaroo rats, and serve to facilitate improved surveys and
monitoring of this elusive species.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3
50,Small Mammal Population Dynamics Across a Native-Invaded Habitat Gradient,"Invasive and non-native vegetation can result in reduced ecosystem function
presumably due to the loss of native plant diversity. Historically, open rangelands of southern
Texas have been invaded by non-native grasses and native, woody shrubs. Small mammals
play numerous vital roles in ecosystems; however, little is known of their response to invasive
vegetation and habitat change in south Texas. To evaluate small mammal population dynamics
across a native-invaded habitat gradient, we sampled small mammals at the Welder Wildlife
Refuge in San Patricio County, Texas, USA. We sampled across six plots: two consisted of
native vegetation, two consisted of invasive vegetation, and two intermediate plots. Data were
collected from 2019-2023 and we recorded 3,206 captures of 9 small mammal species. To
determine the potential influence of invasive vegetation, we compared relative abundance
between each plot for three species (Sigmodon hispidus, Baiomys taylori, and Reithrodontomys
fulvescens). For all three species, we found no significant difference in relative abundance
between the three levels of plant invasion. However, we observed significant differences in
relative abundance between survey season and study years. South Texas rangelands
experience frequent droughts which are known to alter vegetation and small vertebrate
populations. We observed that the relative abundance of small mammal species was lowest
following droughts, which suggests a lag effect on small mammal populations. Therefore,
drought cycling may play a more significant role in regulating small mammal populations than
vegetation structure alone.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3
51,Mapping Collared Peccary Habitat: Species Distribution Modeling in the South Texas Plains & Trans-Pecos Ecoregions,"Collared peccary (hereafter peccary; Pecari tajacu) populations in Texas have shown
considerable variation since the 1940s because of urban development and land-use change,
among other habitat reductions. Historically, peccaries were distributed throughout central,
southern, and western Texas, but current populations occur in the southwestern third of Texas.
Despite their relatively widespread distribution and importance as a game animal, prey item,
and seed disperser, little scholarly work has been done on the species in the state. Therefore,
we seek to identify biotic and abiotic factors that impact peccary distribution across two
ecoregions using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution models (SDM) and presence-
only occurrences from iNaturalist. In Texas, peccary habitat can be described generally as
shrub-dominated semi-arid desert, so we will include these vegetation characteristics into the
SDM, along with herbaceous vegetation,  anthropogenic features (e.g., roads, development),
and agricultural lands. We will develop one SDM per ecoregion (i.e., South Texas Plains and
Trans-Pecos) and then assess the transferability of ecoregion-specific models to predict
distribution in the other ecoregions; this will allow us to assess habitat generality versus
specificity. To date, using data from iNaturalist, we will model 701 observations for the South
Texas Plains and 760 detections for the Trans-Pecos. These results will provide managers with
spatially explicit tools and distribution maps to restore, manage, and protect peccary habitat.
These data can also assist with setting ecoregion-specific season and bag limits, considering
peccary are classified as a game species in Texas.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3
52,Morphometrics can be used to estimate body mass and age in wild pigs,"Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species that cause ≥1.5 billion dollars in
damage annually. In response to these damages, population control efforts such as eradication
are often employed. Population control is necessary to reduce the rapid population growth of the
species, which is driven by large litter sizes, high survival, short interbirth intervals, and
reproductive maturity at a young age. Demographic information facilitates modeling population
size and growth, so morphometrics that can assign an individual to an age class can increase
the precision of population models. To investigate which morphometric characters are reliable
predicters of body mass and age, we captured wild pigs across 6 study sites in southern
Oklahoma. After capture, wild pigs were euthanized, and collected body mass, age, and four
morphometric characters: shoulder height, total body length, and chest and stomach
circumference. We built separate linear regression models for each morphometric measurement
to predict body mass and employed machine learning classifiers (linear discriminant analysis,
discriminant analysis of principal components, and naïve Bayes classifier) to assign wild pigs
into 2, 4, 5, or 6 age groupings using the four morphometrics measurements combined or
individually. Regardless of sex, all four morphometric measurements were highly correlated with
body mass (r² ≥ 0.921); however, chest circumference was the most correlated with body mass
(r² = 0.976). Currently, age class assignments have only been run using linear discriminant
analysis with the shoulder height morphometric and model accuracy was (≥82.6%) for a two age
class model, reproductive and non-reproductive.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3
53,Economic Value of White-tailed Deer in Texas,"Texas ranks among the highest in annual hunters and days spent hunting, and white-
tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are the most sought-after game species in the state. White-
tailed deer hunting is an important contributor to the state’s economy; however, an updated
economic estimate is currently unknown. Our goal was to estimate the economic value of white-
tailed deer in Texas. We conducted a web-based survey of 100,000 Texas hunting license
holders for the 2022–2023 hunting season. Our survey included a filter question directing
participants to either a hunter-focused questionnaire or a landowner-focused questionnaire
assessing hunter expenditures and landowner expenditures and income related to white-tailed
deer. We analyzed survey responses and extrapolated the total reported annual expense to
estimate the statewide impact. We had a 9% response rate, with a total of 9,079 respondents.
Of those, 6,275 were hunters, and 2,804 were landowners. Average expenditures were $3,348
and $18,812 for hunters and landowners, respectively. The largest annual expenditures were
outfitter fees for hunters (average >$1,000) and payroll for landowners (average >$2,900).
Hunters spent an average of $2,904 annually on lease fees. The most common landowner
expenditure was supplemental feed, averaging $3,593 annually. Once extrapolated to include
the nearly 555,000 white-tailed deer hunters and 199,000 white-tailed deer-related landowners
in Texas, total expenditures were $1.9 billion and $2.5 billion for hunters and landowners,
respectively. Total annual expenditures related to white-tailed deer in Texas are estimated to be
$4.3 billion. Understanding the economic value of white-tailed deer in Texas is important when
making management decisions.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3
54,Relative Efficacy of a Novel GPS Tracking Technology for Monitoring African Lion Movement Behavior.,"Solar-powered GPS ear tags represent a novel, cost-effective technology that could
revolutionize large carnivore research and conservation efforts by enabling large-scale analyses
currently precluded by the prohibitive cost of GPS collar technology. These devices may be
particularly useful for monitoring subadult, male carnivores, a demographic often excluded from
tracking research because the industry standard – GPS collars (hereafter, collars) – present a
strangulation hazard during the animal’s growth. While solar-powered GPS ear tags (hereafter,
ear tags) have been used to effectively monitor wild ungulates, to our knowledge, they have
never been systematically deployed on large carnivores. Our objectives were to 1) compare the
relative performance and suitability of a 35 g solar-powered GPS ear tag versus the industry
standard – a GPS collar – for field application on lions (Panthera leo), and 2) compare the effect
of battery management algorithm on ear tag performance. To evaluate the relative
performances of ear tags versus collars, we deployed devices on lions, each fitted with one (1)
ear tag and one (1) collar simultaneously. To assess the effect of battery management algorithm
on ear tag performance, we deployed pairs of ear tags – differing only in battery management
software – on free-ranging cattle. For all analyses, we measured successful fix acquisition rate
(SFR), accuracy, precision and consistency over time as indicators of technological
performance. Our results provide an in-situ comparison of GPS tracking technology, providing
insight into the efficacy of ear tags as an alternative to collars for monitoring lions.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4
55,Assessing the occurrence of large carnivores on pastoral landscapes of the,"Agricultural development is one of the major global threats to wildlife in unprotected
areas. In western Botswana, the Western Kalahari Corridor (WCC) is a 200-km unprotected gap
between the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (38,000 km2) and the Central Kalahari/Khutse game
reserves (55,300 km2) and provides critical connectivity between the parks. Although
designated as a “wildlife management area,” in recent decades the corridor has seen a
significant increase in livestock farming and associated development. To understand the impact
of human development on large carnivores, we conducted a camera trap study in the WCC. Our
site was an unprotected and mostly unfenced area of approximately 3,500 km2 centered on the
villages of Bere and Kacgae.  The sparsely populated area is bisected by a single paved
highway and dominated by pastoral farming.  Thirty-two boreholes are scatted around the area
and provide water to remote cattle posts. We placed 120 camera traps, 60 along roads each
paired with a second trap 500-m away from the road.  Each consisted of a single motion-
triggered infrared camera. We checked traps monthly during February – November 2023. We
identified 29 mammal species, including lion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus), cheetah
(Acinonyx jubatus), wild dog (Lycaon pictus), and brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea). We are
using occupancy modelling to identify associations with anthropogenic features including roads,
villages, cattle posts, and livestock activities. Our results will inform wildlife managers and
conservation as to whether the presence of livestock farming in the area impacts the occurrence
of large carnivores in this critical corridor.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4

mortality accounting for twenty percent of all wildlife-related fatalities. This growing conflict
generates negative attitudes towards the Common Leopard (Panthera pardus), threatening
effective human-leopard coexistence and the species' survival. Our study investigates local
attitudes toward the Common Leopard and its conservation in the community forests of Nepal's
mid-hill region. We conducted 123 household surveys, collecting data regarding demographics,
socioeconomic factors, general attitudes toward leopard conservation, and human-leopard
conflict incidents. Results reveal socioeconomic status, education, and income significantly
impact local perceptions. Higher socioeconomic status and education levels associate with
positive attitudes, while lower-income individuals often view leopards as threatening to their
safety and livelihoods. Despite prevalent retaliatory killings and negative perceptions, few
respondents received education regarding leopards and their conservation. Additionally, though
ecotourism is lucrative in other areas of Nepal, few respondents felt they could benefit
economically from wildlife. Our study stresses community engagement's importance in
conservation. Addressing social factors influencing attitudes is crucial for successful long-term
conservation. Our results suggest education initiatives, community involvement, and ensuring
economic benefits from wildlife could shift perceptions. Ultimately, aligning conservation
strategies with community interests is critical to successful and sustainable leopard
conservation. Our research provides a roadmap for future projects, highlighting the need for
strategies considering the socioeconomic realities of communities living alongside leopards.
Understanding and addressing local needs and concerns can help foster positive perceptions of

prey species to minimize predation risk, allowing them to exploit high-quality resources while
avoiding encounters with predators.  However, there are still ecological systems in which these
patterns remain largely unexplored. Our objective was to assess the diel activity patterns of
ungulates and their associated predators at Niokolo Koba National Park. In 2013, we conducted
a single-season camera survey at two study sites within the park: Linguekountou (04 February
to 23 April) and Niokolo (30 April to 07 July). We deployed paired cameras for 2,014 trap nights
in Linguekountou and 1,707 trap nights in Niokolo and collected vegetation metrics at 30
locations per site. We used the Kernel Density Estimator to analyze the coefficient of activity
overlap ( d̂) across both sites to assess how predation risk affects the diel activity of ungulates.
Results suggest that ungulates share a moderate temporal activity overlap ( d̂ = 0.43) with their
associated predators, with Bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) indicating the highest temporal
activity overlap ( d̂= 0.61; n = 425), and Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) indicating the
lowest temporal activity overlap ( d̂ = 0.27; n = 813) among associated predators. These data

conservation landscapes in the world. Historically, the region was largely undeveloped and
sparsely populated.  However, in recent decades, agricultural development and encroachment
by human communities and livestock have significantly impacted this system.  By developing
artificial water points for livestock grazing, humans have altered the presence and behavior of
both domestic and native herbivores, resulting in patterns of herbivory different than those under
which the system evolved.  This may have altered vegetation communities, potentially affecting
biodiversity.   We sampled small mammal and plant communities at 10 sites near the villages of
Bere and Kacgae, Botswana. Sites were situated along an herbivory gradient between <1 km
and >4 km from the nearest artificial water point.  We sampled 160 trap-nights per site for a total

60,Snake Captures Decline as a Function of Trap Age: Implications for Monitoring Programs,"Demographic and diversity studies rely on sampling techniques that produce
representative samples from populations and communities. Snakes, with their cryptic behaviors
and prolonged periods of inactivity, make population and community assessments particularly
challenging. In terrestrial ecosystems, box traps paired with drift fences have been used widely
to survey for large-bodied snakes. However, there has been anecdotal evidence that suggests
snakes become trap shy over time, reducing capture rates. Utilizing a long-term trapping
dataset of snake captures throughout forests in east Texas and western Louisiana, we sought to
determine if snake capture rate declined as a function of trap age (i.e., time it was installed on
the landscape). Total snake captures declined across all traps (n = 43) across time when
comparing the first year of trapping to subsequent years. These results suggest that to
maximize capture success, long-term monitoring programs should attempt to move box traps to

62,Texas Tortoise Movement Patterns Following Three Soft Release Periods After Translocation,"Texas tortoises (Gopherus berlandieri) are a state threatened species in Texas that
has experienced sharp declines in population number, and their distribution has become
sporadic.  Southern Texas lomas, grasslands, and brushlands are the habitat where tortoises
can be found; however, urban-suburbanization and commercial development are reducing
available habitat for tortoises.  Translocation often is suggested as a mitigation option; however,
we are unaware of any research that investigated the effects of translocation on Texas tortoises
to verify that translocation is a responsible management option.  Therefore, we translocated 222
Texas tortoises from a property under development in extreme southern Texas and placed them
in equal numbers within 3, 2.4 ha enclosures near Kingsville, Texas.  Approximately 26
tortoises/enclosure were outfitted with GPS transmitters to follow their movements.  Tortoises
were maintained in enclosures for 4, 8, and 12 months as a soft release measure, after which,
enclosure walls were removed and tortoises had free-choice to leave the area.  Tortoises did
not display directional movement or attempt to home, but randomly moved in all directions after
each time period.  No differences in movement patterns or distances were observed between
male and female tortoises.  On average, tortoises moved ~25m/day.  Mortality rates between
soft release periods of translocated tortoises and between translocated tortoises and resident
tortoises were similar.  Therefore, translocation does not appear to have an immediate negative
impact on Texas tortoises.  Also, a soft release period of 4 months that incorporates one
brumation appears sufficient to halt the homing tendency of Texas tortoises.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4

parameters of M. temminckii in habitats of varying intensities of passive fishing pressure, while
also quantifying the extent and persistence of passive fishing gear in aquatic habitats. From
June – December 2023, we surveyed for M. temminckii and conducted passive fishing gear

65,Comparing the survival of repatriated and wild alligator snapping turtles in eastern Texas,"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is the largest freshwater turtle
in North America. As such, M. temminckii are sought after for human consumption and are
vulnerable to overharvest or bycatch. Despite having protection from harvest in Texas since the
1980s, M. temminckii are still harvested illegally for food and novelty products. Given their life
history, such threats may exacerbate declines in local populations. Therefore, efforts that can
bolster wild populations are of importance to M. temminckii conservation. In June 2021, 8 M.
temminckii confiscated by federal agents were released at the Angelina/Neches Dam B WMA.
Using survival as a metric to evaluate repatriation efforts, we monitored these previously
released repatriated turtles alongside 10 wild turtles. We estimated survival probabilities using
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to account for inconsistencies in radiotelemetry data, and to
assess how certain covariates (e.g., home range, movement, habitat use, etc.) may impact
survival. Overall, repatriated M. temminckii had significantly lower survival than wild M.
temmincki. Movement distance between relocations and time of year had a significant influence
on repatriated turtle survival. Some reductions in survival probability were likely linked to sex-
specific differences in behavior; however, wild M. temminckii had high survival regardless of
sex. These results highlight how long-term studies are often difficult, but neccessary to assess
survival in long-lived species. Understanding factors that influence M. temminckii survival can
inform future conservation efforts, and are especially valuable to translocation efforts attempting
to bolster wild populations.

67,Leveraging Citizen Science to Assess the Impact of Drought and Land-Use Change on Northern Bobwhite Population Stability,"Despite the overall decline of Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), some
population strongholds remain, spread patchily across the species range and encompassing
multiple different ecoregions and habitat types. To successfully arrest the decline of Northern
Bobwhite, identifying areas where quail are succeeding, where they are in decline, and what
factors are driving quail population dynamics across their range is critical. Furthermore, it is
important to conduct these analyses across a large spatiotemporal scale to account for annual
stochasticity in environmental conditions and structural variation in quail habitat. Although local
quail covey count data is typically a more accurate index of quail abundance, there is significant
variation in data collection methodology among state agencies, which makes comparing these
estimates across time and large geographic areas difficult. Because North American Breeding
Bird Survey (BBS) data collection protocols are nationally standardized, population estimates
based on BBS data can be easily compared across a large spatiotemporal scale. Here, we
introduce SaveBirds (www.savebirds.app), a web application designed for wildlife practitioners
to mine and format BBS data for multiple analyses of avian population trends and present the
results of a case-study on Northern Bobwhite quail. We used SaveBirds to acquire Northern
Bobwhite count data from 1,717 BBS routes for a 20-year period from 1999-2019. We
conducted an Emerging Hotspot Analysis to identify areas of high (HotSpot) and low (ColdSpot)
quail population productivity. We then employed Multiscale Geographically Weighted
Regression to examine the influence of land-use change and drought on quail population
productivity around HotSpots and ColdSpots.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4
68,Fat Bobwhites: Does Supplemental Feed Maintain Northern Bobwhite Mass Over Winter?,"Research has indicated that northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) with heavier
mass and higher body fat composition are associated with reduced physiological stress and a
greater likelihood of surviving severe weather. Mass and percent body fat have also been found
to decrease from late fall to early spring.  To alleviate those trends, managers often provide
supplemental feed throughout the winter, but the effects are relatively unknown.  This study
aims to determine if providing supplemental feed aids in maintaining body mass of bobwhites
through the winter period.  The project is taking place on the East Foundation property in Jim
Hogg County, with two designated sites consisting of a 2,111-ha fed site and a 6,118-ha unfed
site, both under the same harvest rate (20% of fall population).   Grain sorghum is distributed
weekly on the fed site from the first week in December through the end of the hunting season at
a rate of 19.4 kg/km. During the 2022-2023 state-wide quail hunting season, we collected mass
measurements from 841 hunter-harvested bobwhites (342=fed site, 499=unfed).  We randomly
selected 100 bobwhites from each study site, only including those who were either adults or
over 150 days old.  We found no significant difference between body mass from the fed or unfed
sites (t=1.11, df=192.6, P=0.268), with mean body masses of 149.3 ± 1.0 SE grams and 150.0 ±
1.2 SE grams, respectively.  Although supplemental feed may increase the survival of
bobwhites, our preliminary results revealed this was not in the form of additional body mass.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4
69,Evolution and Outcomes of American Oystercatcher Monitoring Along the Upper Texas Coast,"Across many coastal environments, there is an ever-present threat to waterbirds
consisting of changes in both quantity and quality of breeding and foraging habitat. One such
species, the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), is a species of high concern for
the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan and is a Texas Wildlife Action Plan priority species.
Because this species faces serious threats due to its restriction to coastal areas, suspected
increase in nest predators, potential contamination of food resources, and habitat alterations
through erosion, storm systems, and human modification, Gulf Coast Bird Observatory initiated
a long-term study in 2011 to monitor annual productivity and document locations in need of
restoration and habitat management. Since 2011, oystercatcher annual nesting success has
ranged from 14–81%, with an average of 51%. Monitoring efforts have evolved as more birds
were color banded, allowing for yearly resights and specific pair information. This has led to an
understanding of pair behavior and movements, recruitment, and breeding territory analysis.
Through this project, GCBO has gained insight into the determinants of nesting success and
failure, including environmental variables, disturbance factors, and territory quality. With the
decrease in oyster shell island size and elevation due to erosion, it is suspected that the number
of nesting pairs has decreased as a direct response to these changes. Accordingly, these
observations have led to increased recognition of the plight of American Oystercatchers, with
multiagency collaboration and partnerships committed to continued monitoring efforts, public
education and outreach, and the conservation of this at-risk species.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4
70,Cowbird trapping permitting review,"Cowbird trapping is used to help recover endangered black-capped vireos (BCVI).
The BCVI was listed in 1987 and recovered in 2018 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service

period, 2019-2030. There is no federal regulatory provision that extends trapping beyond a
delisting. Managers at Fort Cavazos must either 1) attain a cowbird federal depredation permit,
or 2) use the terms and conditions in the current Cowbird Depredation Order. If Texas trappers
trap under the Cowbird Depredation Order for BCVI, they must monitor two lists; including the
Texas Species of Greatest Conservation Concern, and/or the U.S. Birds of Conservation
Concern and ensure the BCVI is listed in atleast one of two of those lists. Trappers who failure
to trap under the authority of a current cowbird depredation permit, or under the terms outlined

71,Variation in Microplastic Contamination Across Development and Within Brood of Nestling House Sparrows,"Microplastic pollution is an emerging threat to environmental and human health, with
concomitant impacts to wildlife, including many species of birds. However, the majority of avian
studies have been conducted on seabirds. Despite passerines comprising more than half of all
bird species, little is known about how microplastic pollutants impact passerine health. We
initiated a pilot study to better understand the abundance of microplastic pollution in songbirds
in summer 2023, utilizing house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings as our model taxa
through a non-lethal method of microplastic detection (i.e., collection of fecal sacs). House
sparrows, being a widespread and human-commensalist species, are ideal bioindicators for
microplastic pollution. Our objectives were to determine how microplastic abundance varied
across nestling development and among nestlings within a nest. We collected fecal sacs from
nestlings at established house sparrow nest colonies in Stephenville, TX, Fargo, ND, Easton,
PA, and Lexington, KY. After collection, we subjected samples to chemical digestion using 30%
H2O2, vacuum filtration, and examination under a stereomicroscope. We compared microplastic
contamination using two metrics: density (number of microplastics/gram fecal matter) and length
(mm/gram fecal matter). We detected microplastic contaminants in 83.6% of samples for our
Texas colonies (n = 128) and 63.5% of samples for our Pennsylvania colonies (n = 74).
Preliminary results suggest no difference in microplastic abundance between young (day 2) and
old (day 10) nestlings. By conducting this study on house sparrows, we can obtain broader
insight into the prevalence of microplastic pollution within passerine species.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 4
72,Parental Attentiveness in House Sparrows Across a Latitudinal Temperature Gradient,"Ambient temperatures are changing across the globe and generating a broad range
of behavioral responses in many species, including birds. Behavior is one of the first
adjustments that organisms can make to cope with stressful environmental conditions.
Temperature variation can cause birds to force trade-offs with other behaviors at the expense of
thermoregulation. One way to examine potential responses to temperature change is to
evaluate behaviors across temperature gradients. Our study examines parental incubation
behaviors in free-living House sparrows (Passer domesticus) across a latitudinal and
temperature gradient from Texas and North Dakota populations. We hypothesized that ambient
temperature is associated with variation in parental incubation on-bouts and nest material
delivery rates, and that these behaviors are longer when temperatures are extreme. From May–
July 2022 and 2023, we recorded parental attentiveness on incubation days 5, 6, or 7 using
video cameras at nest boxes for 4 hours in the morning. Results found no support for our
hypothesis across the season in 2022 and 2023. However, in 2022, female on-bouts were
longer in North Dakota (n = 26, mean = 34.6 min/hr, 95% CI = 31.6–37.7 min/hr) than in Texas
(n = 27, mean = 24.6 min/hr, 95% CI = 20.7–28.5 min/hr; F 3,132 = 17.81, p ≤ 0.001). This
study will increase our understanding of how temperature influences parental attentiveness in
passerines, with implications for how birds could respond to climate change.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 4
73,Parental provisioning in house sparrows does not vary across temperature gradients,"The mechanisms behind Bergmann’s rule are poorly understood, but one possibility
is parental behavioral differences across temperature gradients influence body size. In birds,
food delivery rates can influence altricial young growth rates resulting in body mass differences
at fledging. Environmental variables associated with temperature could alter feeding rates. Our
study evaluated house sparrow (Passer domesticus) feeding rates across temperature and
latitudinal gradients from Texas to North Dakota. We hypothesized that ambient temperature
would influence parental feeding rates and nestling body size. If hot temperatures reduce food
availability and increase metabolic demands of adults, then feeding rates should decrease
resulting in smaller nestling body sizes. We predicted this relationship to be stronger in the
southern sites. We provided nest boxes for house sparrows across our study sites. On day 5, 6,
or 7 post-hatching, we recorded parental feeding using video cameras placed approximately 2
m from nest boxes for 4 hours in the morning (between 0630-1130 hrs). We collected
morphological measurements of nestlings on days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 post-hatch. Results
showed that nestlings are larger in North Dakota than in Texas on day 10 post-hatch (F3,1302 =
62.88, P < 0.001). However, there is no difference in feeding rates between North Dakota and
Texas ( F1,175 = 2.89, P = 0.091). This study will increase our understanding of how parental
feeding rates are associated with differences in body size and temperature, with implications for
how birds might respond",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 4
74,Exposure of terrestrial birds to microplastic: The effects of ecological traits,"Microplastics (<5mm) have been found extensively in marine organisms, including
seabirds, and have been found to have deleterious effects on birds. However, little is known
about the potential exposure of terrestrial birds to microplastics despite plastic pollution being
pervasive in terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, whether bird species are differently exposed
based on ecological traits is largely unknown. This study aims to (1) investigate the exposure of
terrestrial birds to microplastics by examining gastrointestinal contents and (2) explore potential
relationships between microplastic exposure, diet type, and foraging strategies. Birds were
opportunistically collected during window strike surveys in Texas, and nine species were
selected to represent a broad range of distinct diet types and foraging strategies. The bird
species selected were Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla
cedrorum), Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), House Wren (Troglodytes aedon),
Nashville Warbler (Leiothlypis ruficapilla), Purple Martin (Progne subis), Ruby-throated
Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris), White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis), and
Great-tailed Grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus). The esophagus through the intestines were
carefully removed from bird carcasses (n=108) and digested in a 10% potassium hydroxide
solution. The resulting solution was filtered, and microplastics were individually extracted,
characterized, and counted under a stereomicroscope. To ensure accurate identification,
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to verify polymer type. Results
suggest that most birds assessed were exposed to microplastics, with ground-feeding birds that
have omnivorous and granivorous diets consuming the greatest quantities of microplastics. This
research contributes valuable insights into the underexplored realm of microplastic in terrestrial
avian populations.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 4
75,"Impact of Livestock Guardian Dogs, Small Livestock, and Anthropogenic Features on Mesopredator Abundance in the Kalahari Desert","Livestock depredation is a major cause of human-wildlife conflict in African pastoral
communities. These communities practice traditional farming systems in which livestock (e.g.,
cattle, horse, sheep, and goat) roam freely at a centralized grazing location with a drilled
borehole for water needs. Studies have shown black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and
caracal (Caracal caracal) frequently predate on small livestock (sheep and goat) in grazing
areas. As a result, farmers use livestock guardian dogs (Canis lupus familiaris; LGD) to deter
mesopredators from livestock. In this study, our primary objective is to understand the effects of
LGDs and small livestock on mesopredator abundance in relation to anthropogenic features in
the Kalahari landscape of Botswana. We will examine how small livestock herds with and
without LGDs influence targeted (jackal and caracal) and non-targeted mesopredators. Our
study site is in the Ghanzi District (GH10 and GH11) at the villages of Bere and Kacgae. We
deployed a network of 120 game cameras across the study site from January to December
2023; 60 camera traps were placed on sand or gravel roads and were paired with a second
camera approximately 500 m perpendicular to the road into the bush. Cameras were checked
once a month, and images were processed using TimeLapse. We will conduct future analyses
in spring 2024 to examine mesopredator diversity and richness at roads, cattle posts, and
villages. The findings of this study will provide insight into how mesopredator populations are

interested in (1) whether white-tailed deer represent a disproportionate amount of mountain lion
diet in South Texas compared to other prey species, and (2) the age and sex of white-tailed
deer that are killed by mountain lions. Our primary study sites will be the Comanche and Faith
Ranches outside of Eagle Pass. We will investigate these questions using (1) GPS collar data

objective is to examine seasonal habitat use and activity of waterfowl at two locations in north
central Texas, where little information is known about waterfowl in the area: Tarleton State
University’s Timberlake Biological Field Station and Palo Pinto Mountains State Park, set to
open to the public in late 2024. These sites are in two different ecoregions, managed for wildlife,

conducted field surveys at water sources every two weeks. During surveys, we documented
numbers, species, sex, behavior, and arrival and departure time. We are continuing these
surveys at both study areas from November 2023 to April 2024. We placed game cameras at
water sources at both study areas in April 2023 and will monitor cameras for at least one year.
From November 2022 to March 2023, we observed 6 species, primarily ringneck (Aythya
collaris) and American wigeon (Mareca americana) at the state park. From April 2023 to
November 2023, we observed wood ducks (Aix sponsa) and blue-winged teal (Spatula discors)

78,Influence of Weather and Urbanization on Coyote Activity across the U.S.,"One of the major causes of species extinction is urbanization. In fact, urbanization
endangers more species and affects more land space in the United States than any other
human activity. However, climate change is causing unprecedented changes to weather, which
also affects wildlife. Recent research on urban mesopredators suggests a consistent trend
toward declining species richness with increasing urban intensity. However, not all research
areas or species exhibit these patterns. One of these mesopredators, the coyote (Canis latrans)
is an opportunistic carnivore that has adapted to the spread of urbanization and are now present
in large metropolitan areas. In this study, we used camera trap data from Snapshot, a multi-
institutional collaboration, collected from 2019 - 2020 to perform a comparison between weather
and urbanization to compare effects on coyote activity across the United States. We
hypothesized that urbanization would have a greater impact on coyote activity. We used a linear
regression model with count of coyotes as the response variable and a suite of weather and
urbanization covariates as continuous predictor variables. Our results suggest that the mean
road density (p= 0.02160), cultivated lands (p= 0.00869), and GPP (gross primary productivity)
(p= 0.0369) had the greatest negative effect on coyote activity. We suggest further research on
coyote activity in metropolitan areas because even though coyotes can adapt to urbanization,
there are some urbanized components that have a negative effect on coyote activity.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
79,A Gut Content Composition Analysis of Four Native Fishes of the Red River.,"River regulation and degraded riparian habitat can diminish resource heterogeneity
that supports riverine food-webs of prairie fishes. Yet, the ecology of many prairie stream fishes
is not well understood including baseline knowledge about spatial and temporal variation in diet
habits as the availability and quality of aquatic and terrestrial food sources change. Here, we
characterize the diets of four species of greatest conservation need, in the Red River: Red River
Pupfish (Cyprinodon rubrofluviatilis), Plains Minnow (Hybognathus placitus), Prairie
Chub (Macrhybopsis australis), and Red River Shiner (Notropis bairdi). We attempted to collect
ten of each species at each site for our six sites across the Red River from spring, summer and
fall of 2023. Gut contents were extracted using a luer syringe, homogenized in 10 mL of DI
water, and dried onto a gridded filter for characterization of diets. We subsampled 20% of the
filter unless the coverage of diet items occupied less than 50% of the filter. We divided diet
contents into 10 categories to represent aquatic and terrestrial primary producers,
macroinvertebrates, vertebrates, and other miscellaneous items. Feeding strategies and relative
diet specialization were evaluated based on the relationship between prey-specific abundance
and the frequency of occurrence of diet items. For example, Plains Minnow diets were
comprised of high abundance and occurrence of diatoms indicating a more dominant reliance
on aquatic primary production compared to other species. Feeding habits from this analysis will

80,Movements of Feral Cats on the Campus of Abilene Christian University,"Abilene Christian University (ACU) has transformed its perspective on feral cats
(Felis catus), viewing them not as nuisances but as assets in managing pests on campus.
Through implementation of a Trap-Neuter-Release (TNR) program, ACU has neutered 120 cats

and interactions for effective management. This study aimed to enhance our understanding of
movement patterns of feral cats on the ACU campus, explore interactions between different
sub-populations, and provide preliminary data for future comprehensive studies. The study,
conducted in the spring of 2023, employed radio telemetry and GPS tracking to collect data on
feral cat behavior. Collars with radio transmitters (less than 5% of body weight) were fitted to 6
cats.  An Apple AirTag (Bluetooth technology) was attached to another cat. Data collection
involved tracking the cats during four six hour time blocks during 4 8-day periods between
February 11, 2023 and April 16, 2023.  Of the 4 cats tracked the length of the study, 2 were
abandoned domesticated cats, while 2 were born feral. The domesticated cats exhibited
different behavior compared to feral cats . Feral cats had larger home ranges, avoiding human
interaction, while domesticated cats had smaller home ranges near feeding sites and high-traffic
areas. Sub-colonies showed no distinct grouping based on feeding sites. Spatial behavior was
influenced by human interaction, feeding sites, and weather conditions. The study identified
potential ecological impacts, such as competition for resources and increased spread of health

81,The Northern Bobwhite Decline in Texas: is Habitat Loss Truly to Blame?,"Habitat loss is considered an ultimate cause of the northern bobwhite (Colinus
virginianus) decline. Even within population strongholds of northern and southern Texas, the
species appears declining and habitat loss is considered the cause. Our objective was to
evaluate the habitat-loss hypothesis by quantifying the long-term trend (1938‒2023) in bobwhite
habitat in northern and southern Texas. We used historical (1938–1992) and projected (1992–
2023) land cover datasets to quantify changes in 2 cover classes associated with habitat loss
(urban and cropland). We also quantified the amount of bobwhite habitat by reclassifying cover
classes into habitat or not habitat. Percent urban approximately doubled (from ≈0.5% to 1.0%)
during 1938–2023 but remained a small percent of the landscape (<2%) in both regions.
Percent cropland also remained stable in northern (18.7‒27.0%) and southern (12.2‒13.1%)
Texas. Moreover, the amount of bobwhite habitat was high and stable in both regions (60–
70%). Thus, we did not find evidence for the habitat-loss hypothesis and hypothesize that other
factors (e.g., a prolonged dry cycle) may be responsible for the bobwhite decline in Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts

more frequent. Wildlife rehabilitation centers have become important resources for a public that
has become increasingly concerned for the well fare of injured wildlife. However, details on
admission rates and outcomes are often lacking. We examined 13 years of admission data for
birds of prey submitted to the South Plains Wildlife Rehabilitation Center and Night Wings
Rehabilitation Center, both located in Lubbock Texas. The raptors submitted were categorized
by reason for admission: 1) collision, 2) illness, and 3) other. Submissions were also
categorized by age: 1) independent (adults and juveniles after their first winter), 2) juveniles in
their first winter, and 3) dependent juveniles (e.g., nestlings and fledglings). Owls however were
categorized only as independent and or dependent juveniles. We recorded 3,231 individuals of
28 raptor species (2 Cathartiformes, 15 Accipitriformes, 4 Falconiformes, and 7 Strigiformes)
admitted during the study period at an average of 248.6 admissions per year.  Seven species
each accounted for ≥ 5% of admissions. Adult and older juveniles accounted for 53%, first
winter juveniles accounting for 14.4%, and nestling and fledglings accounting for 32.5% of
admissions. Collisions accounted for 50% of admissions, various illnesses accounted for 10%,
and rescue/kidnapping of nestlings accounted for 26% of admissions. Among collisions injuries,
the most common presentation was broken wings (51%). Our data indicate raptors are a
commonly admitted taxonomic group, possibly due to their easy recognition and appreciation by
members of the public.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
83,Interactions Between Collared Peccaries and Feral Hogs on a Southern Gulf Coast Rangeland,"Invasive species can negatively impact native species through negative species
interactions and competition for resources.  For example, native collared peccaries (Peccari
tajacu; peccaries) utilize similar habitats and forage as invasive feral hogs (Sus scrofa), which
researchers have speculated is the cause of declines in peccary populations over the last 60
years. In addition, peccaries are known to alter their activity patterns when feral hogs are
present. Our goal was to evaluate potential interactions between peccaries and feral hogs to
better understand the effects of this invasive species on peccaries.  We established 24 remote
camera stations spaced approximately 1 km apart on the Welder Wildlife Refuge in San Patricio
County, Texas. We compared hourly peccary activity at sites with and without feral hog
presence from July 2021 to October 2021. Overall, peccaries exhibited a crepuscular activity
pattern when feral hogs were not present; however, their activity covered a wider range of
activity times in the presence of feral hogs. Specifically, we observed more peccaries in the
early morning, midday, and later in the nighttime at sites with a feral hog presence, suggestive
of avoidance behavior. Species interactions are an important parameter to consider in wildlife
management, especially when invasive species alter the behavior and conservation of native
wildlife populations.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
84,An Assessment of the Impact of Aoudad on Palatable Shrubs at the Fort Davis,"Herbivores strongly influence plant communities by changing vegetation composition,
diversity, and productivity. Moderate browsing has been shown to stimulate growth of lateral
buds along stems, thus increasing forage availability. Over-browsing, however, reduces foliar
cover, affecting the plant’s ability to capture sunlight, photosynthesize, and reproduce. The rapid
population growth and dispersal of aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) following their introduction in
Texas during the 1950s has caused concern about the impact that overabundant exotic
populations may have on native vegetation. This highlights the need to understand how aoudad
are utilizing vegetation and how this resource use impacts the landscape. The Fort Davis
National Historic Site is absent of livestock grazing and a large population of aoudad frequents
the area. These factors make it a suitable site to evaluate plant response to aoudad browsing
pressure. To do so, we selected five species of palatable shrubs: fragrant sumac (Rhus
aromatica), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), littleleaf
leadtree (Leucaena retusa), and gray oak (Quercus grisea). Four individuals from each species
were chosen and monitored using remote cameras to determine ungulate species visitation
frequency and abundance. We built exclosures around two individuals of each species during
July 2023. In October 2023, near the end of the growing season, we measured unlignified
growth on both unexclosed and exclosed plants. Surveys will be repeated in 2024. Results from
the two sets of plants will be compared to quantify the growth difference in plants that
experience browsing pressure from aoudad and those that do not.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
85,How You Measure Matters: Understanding the Scale at Which Bobwhites Respond to Habitat and Rainfall,"Although the positive influence of habitat and rainfall on northern bobwhite (Colinus
virginianus) is well documented, what is unknown is the scale at which populations respond to
these factors. Our objective was to determine the influence of scale on habitat- and rainfall-quail
relationships in northern and southern Texas. We used roadside survey data from Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department to estimate bobwhite relative abundance in northern (n = 71 routes)
and southern (n = 36 routes) Texas. We then used 2019 National Land Cover Data and
CropScape imagery to quantify bobwhite habitat and PRISM to obtain annual rainfall. We
buffered survey routes to various radii (from 250-m to 25-km) and quantified the amount of
habitat and rainfall. We used a generalized linear model to quantify the relationship between
bobwhite abundance and habitat (or rainfall) at each buffer size and used psuedo-r2 to quantify
the strength of the relationship. In northern Texas, we documented a positive relationship
between bobwhite abundance and habitat and a negative relationship between abundance and
rainfall across all buffer sizes. The strongest relationship for both variables occurred at the 25-
km buffer (psuedo-r2=0.07 and 0.32, respectively). In southern Texas, we also documented a
positive relationship between bobwhite abundance and habitat, with the strongest relationship at
the 10-km and 25-km buffers (psuedo-r2=0.06). However, there were no significant
relationships between abundance and rainfall. Our results illustrate the strong influence that
scale may have on relationships and how failure to consider its influence may result in
contrasting conclusions.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts

past few hundred years have affected wildlife. While these changes have been disastrous to
countless species, a few species are urban exploiters and urban adapters and remain abundant

camera trap data from across the USA available through Snapshot to assess striped skunk
relationships with urbanization and weather. We expected fewer skunk observations in areas
with greater anthropogenic development. We then used generalized linear models with negative
binomial responses in RStudio to examine potential relationships between anthropogenic
covariates (cultivated land, wild vegetation, gross primary productivity, impervious ground cover,
and housing density) and weather covariates (maximum temperature, minimum temperature,
precipitation, and temperature difference) A total of 176,425 trap nights resulted in 482 skunk
detections. No anthropogenic covariates[SF1]  had a significant effect on skunk observations. In
2019, mean precipitation significantly affected the likelihood of skunk observations (p= 0.018),
with an inverse relationship between skunk observations and mean precipitation. In 2020,
average daily temperature difference (p= 0.009) and minimum temperature (p= 0.013) affected
skunk observations, with a direct relationship between both covariates and skunk observations.
Previous studies posit that skunk observations occur most frequently in areas of moderate
human disturbance. Since striped skunks are cryptic and did not appear very frequently on
camera, getting skunks in hand and tracking them via GPS collar may assist with further study
into anthropogenic effects on skunks.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
87,Scaled Quail Food Preference in West Texas,"Quail populations are declining across the United States. Scaled quail (Callipepla
squamata) have declined by 66% in Texas.  Identifying specific food preferences can allow
proper management of this species in West Texas where birds once flourished but have
declined due to poor land use practices. A few studies investigate the diet selection of scaled
quail and have been performed in Arizona and New Mexico. However, few have been limited in
west Texas. Enhancing plant species preferred across the landscape can provide viable
populations for future establishment by dispersal and provide connectivity between scaled quail
populations. Crop contents were analyzed from 60 harvested birds. Contents of each crop were
separated by seed, mast, vegetative, and insect. A total of 749 plant species were found in all
crops with 133 individual plants. This results in an average of 13 different plant species per
crop. Forbs were the most common component, followed by woody plants, succulents, grasses
and insects. Seeds represented 62% of the food components consumed. Seeds from woody
plants, grasses, and succulents are important and may provide a nutritional bridge that occurs
seasonally to meet energetic requirements.  Due to the diversity and abundance of forbs in
scaled quail diets, managers may be wise to carefully plan widespread applications of
herbicides (i.e Spike) on the landscape that result in forb kill if the management of scaled quail
is an important ranch objective.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
88,"Bushbuck Distribution in Niokolo Koba Park, in Senegal, West Africa","Large mammal populations are facing a global decline. The bushbuck has a wide
distribution throughout Africa, and it is an important ecological and socioeconomic species, but
few studies exist on this species, especially in Senegal. In Niokolo Koba National Park, in the
southeast of Senegal, we studied the bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) distribution. Our first
objective is to investigate their spatial distribution across the entire protected area. The second
objective is to identify important landscape and habitat variables explaining their distribution. In
2013, we conducted a single-season camera survey at the park's study sites: Linguekountou
(04 February to 23 April) and Niokolo (30 April to 07 July). We deployed paired cameras and
collected vegetation metrics at 30 locations per site. We deployed cameras for 2,014 trap nights
in Linguekountou and 1,707 trap nights in Niokolo. The trap nights have resulted in 4,511 animal
detections, which included 1,842 ungulate detections, including 425 bushbuck detections
(Linguekountou; n = 310, Niokolo; n = 115). We will use Maxent software and ArcGIS to model
bushbuck distribution and examine habitat use. This data will provide a better understanding of
bushbucks’ distribution and variables influencing their occurrence within the two sites of Niokolo
Koba National Park.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
89,Advancements in Population Monitoring: Evaluating Space to Event Models for White-Tailed Deer Surveys in Rangeland Ecosystems,"White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations play a crucial ecological role in
rangeland ecosystems and hold significant economic and conservation importance. White-tailed
deer populations are monitored via methods such as aerial surveys, spotlight counts, and trail
camera surveys. Each method offers a different combination of strengths and weaknesses in
terms of accuracy. Trail camera surveys have become popular due to ease of use but
population estimation from cameras without individually marked animals is challenging. For
instance, baited surveys can result in skewed sex and age ratios, leading to population
underestimation. Additionally, some methods require auxiliary data, such as animal movement
rates, which can be difficult to obtain. Recently, there have been developments in using space
to event (STE) models by using time-lapse settings in trail cameras. The STE model is based on
using the total area of the viewshed that is photographed until an animal is detected to generate
an estimate of animal density. We are evaluating STE models in a 92-ha, game-fenced site
containing White-tailed deer near Kingsville, Texas, USA. Results of the STE models will be
compared with White-tailed deer population estimates generated by baited camera surveys and
aerial drone surveys using thermal cameras. Successful implementation of the STE method
could offer a versatile, noninvasive approach applicable to species of large animals.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
90,Wildlife Disease Research In Texas: Trends Over The Past Three Decades,"Texas encompasses a unique geographical region that spans ten ecoregions and
hosts a diversity of wildlife. It is also a central point for major bird migratory flyways, hosts >
1930 km of international border with high movement of people and animals, and is situated in a
climatic region expected to warm significantly in the next few decades. These factors make
Texas a region of interest for understanding wildlife disease emergence and zoonotic disease
risk. Here, we reviewed three decades of literature reporting wildlife diseases in Texas to
understand regional and temporal trends. We utilized the Web of Science platform to perform a
literature review using the following search terms and Boolean operators: “disease” AND
“wildlife” AND “Texas”, which returned 772 primary research articles as of September 2023.
These were filtered by a strict set of criteria to identify >90 primary articles. We noted a gradual
increase in disease research in Texas with most studies focused on cervids, feral species (e.g.,
Sus scrofa), and species at the urban-wild interface (e.g., coyotes [Canis latrans] and raccoons
[Procyon lotor]). Pathogens that were most prevalent in the literature were vector-borne,
including Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease).
Zoonotic diseases comprised >50% of the literature reviewed. We acknowledge that, in part,
these trends reflect researcher interests and funding opportunities; however, it shouldn’t
diminish the importance of Texas as a geographically important region as species distributions
shift and vectors experience less seasonality with climate change.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
91,Assessing the Efficacy of Integrating Light Meters with GPS Transmitters for Use in Wildlife Research,"Vegetation cover and structure provide critical protection from abiotic conditions and
can limit predation risk for many wildlife species. Measures of overhead vegetation are typically
collected with handheld methods that are limited logistically at large scales, or remotely sensed,
which can be cost-prohibitive. Given the importance of overhead vegetation in structuring
ecological patterns and the difficulty of collecting this information, alternative methods to
estimate overhead vegetation is a critical need in wildlife research. Many wildlife tracking
devices are solar-powered and often collect light-intensity data that are typically used to assess
transmitter battery performance. As overhead vegetation cover intercepts light, light-intensity
data collected from these tracking devices may also be used as an index of overhead
vegetation cover. To explore this possibility, we tested the performance of GPS transmitters
equipped with a light meter and compared readings to scientific-grade light meters. In August
2023, we conducted 97 paired light meter comparisons in Dimmit County, Texas, USA. Within
stratified vegetation communities (Tamaulipan thornscrub or mesquite grassland), paired light
meters were deployed in low, medium, and high shrub cover areas. Data were collected every
hour for a minimum of 24 hours at each location. In addition to categorical measurements of
shrub cover, overhead leaf area index was collected using a ceptometer. Preliminary analyses
will explore the comparative relationship between light intensity and overhead vegetation cover
to determine if these data can act as a proxy for vegetation cover at locations used by wildlife
species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
92,Perceptions of Livestock Owners and Herders on Lion Coexistence in the Kalahari Landscape,"Human-lion conflict is likely to occur in areas where there is high livestock
encroachment into lion (Panthera leo) territories. In the Ghanzi District of Botswana, the number
of cattle posts (designated areas for keeping livestock) has grown rapidly in the last 50 years.
As a result, livestock depredation by lions has significantly increased. This is cause for concern
for both lion conservation and the economic sustainability of farmers’ livelihoods, especially
because this region provides critical connectivity between lion populations in the Central
Kalahari Game Reserve and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, two of the largest protected
areas in southern Africa. To effectively alleviate potential human-wildlife conflicts arising from
lion depredation, mitigation efforts should actively involve local stakeholders to ensure long-term
efficacy. However, these strategies are often implemented without consulting those who are
expected to coexist with wildlife. The objective of our study is to gauge the perceptions of
livestock owners and herders in the Ghanzi district coexisting with lions. We collected data
through a combination of face-to-face and telephone interviews in which respondents answered
a series of open-ended questions regarding their livestock management practices and past
experiences with wild predators. We asked respondents to share their ideas on human-lion
conflict mitigation and coexistence strategies. We will use cultural consensus analyses to
compare the perceptions of respondents according to their respective experiences with lions.
These results will provide valuable insight into which mitigation strategies are both effective and
acceptable to the farming community.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
93,Effects of Minimizing Soil Disturbance on Restoring Cedar-Elm Encroached Riparian Grasslands,"In the last 200 years, 80% of riparian corridors have disappeared in North America
and Europe. Riparian corridors are diverse and stable ecosystems that provide habitat for the
movement of wildlife. Woody plant encroachment of native and invasive trees within riparian
floodplain grasslands alters ecological services and hinders movement of wildlife. Native
perennial bunch grasses average 0.3-1m in height and root systems extend 3-5m. These deep
and fibrous root systems stabilize soil and assist in water infiltration in these riparian grasslands.
Woody encroachment on grasslands is a global phenomenon that is transitioning grasslands to
shrubland ecosystems. Woody plant encroachment of historical riparian floodplain grasslands
within Texas results in closed canopy hardwood forests with understories dominated by cool
season, annual grasses, and forbs that alter the below ground composition within these
ecosystems.  Biodiversity is essential for riparian corridors with 70% of vertebrate species
utilizing these corridors throughout their lifespan. Native cedar elm within the cross-timbers and
prairies region of Texas can become the dominant woody plant species within unmanaged
riparian floodplain grasslands, creating a monoculture that drastically alters the plant
community. Management and restoration efforts to restore these grasslands include prescribed
burning or intrusive soil tilling. Here, we investigate the efficacy of restoring a cedar elm
encroached riparian grassland through different seeding methods and minimizing soil
disturbance. This research will help develop and inform management decisions for the
restoration of historical riparian grasslands within central Texas as wildlife corridors.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
94,Effects of Feral Swine on the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of White-Tailed Deer,"White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and feral swine (Sus scrofa) engage in
interspecific competition for resources within ecological systems. Ordinarily, feral swine exert
competitive pressure, displacing white-tailed deer from the area, resulting in each species'
predominant occupation of distinct habitats. Nevertheless, certain circumstances may lead to
the co-occurrence of white-tailed deer and feral swine within the same habitat, fostering
resource-sharing dynamics. To better understand this relationship, we used game cameras to
conduct a multi-season analysis of the occurrence of white-tailed deer and feral swine in Palo
Pinto Mountains State Park in northcentral Texas. The objective is to evaluate both species'
occurrence patterns across various camera survey sites, focusing on investigating species'
temporal and spatial patterns for potential interspecies interactions. We have actively monitored
white-tailed deer, and feral swine since April 2021. Our methods involve placing 20 game
cameras 51 cm above ground level, in randomly selected locations, and spaced at least 250
meters apart. We will monitor white-tailed deer and feral swine at each camera site throughout
the summer and winter seasons from 2021 to 2023. We use TimeLapse software to evaluate
data collected from each camera site. Our findings will be shared with local wildlife management
authorities to further conservation and management practices to ensure the longevity of the
Parks ecosystem.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
95,Using Non-Invasive Technologies to Determine Species Richness and Abundance in Support of an Applied Conservation Genetics Project,"Measuring species presence and abundance can be useful for designing
conservation management plans, or as a first step in directing applied conservation genetics
projects. While there are many methods for measuring such attributes, trail cameras have
become very popular non-invasive tools for recording species richness, abundance, animal
behavior, and even identifying individual animals if unique markings or morphology are evident.
The purpose of this research was to measure coyote (Canis latrans) abundance and estimate
coyote morphology at sites in the Hill Country, San Antonio, and Galveston, TX areas. The
results of this project are being used to guide efforts for coyote scat collection, in support of a
larger applied conservation genetics research project. Multiple trail cameras were placed at
every site, each was baited, and a series of markers were used in the camera’s view to estimate
morphology of coyotes. Cameras were active for a minimum of 30 days at each site and after
collection, photos were analyzed to calculate trap events, trap success, species diversity and
evenness for all wildlife recorded. Morphology measurements were estimated for body length,
shoulder height, width of head and tail length, if and when they were visible in photos with a
scale present. The results of this research will be used to target areas for coyote scat collection,
to support a conservation genetics project that is investigating levels of hybridization present in
coyotes and analyzing diet of these animals.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
96,Efficacy of Juniper Removal on Plant Communities within Riparian Corridors in the Palo Pinto Mountains Region of Texas,"Riparian corridors contribute to landscape-level ecological diversity.  In semi-arid
rangelands, they exist as fragments and persist only because of the unique hydrologic regime of
the riparian zone. However, they also contribute, as well as the surrounding watershed
vegetation, to the hydraulic regime which they depend on. Woody encroachment of juniper
species into rangelands has widespread and ongoing impacts on grassland ecosystems and
their linked ecosystems. In this project we characterized the riparian community of several
ephemeral stream reaches prior to and following restoration activities along established riparian
buffers in Palo Pinto County, Texas. Based on information from historical aerial photos, field
measurements, and NRCS Ecological Site Descriptions, land use has significantly shifted the
plant community away from its presumed historic reference community. This work is done in
relation to restoration activities that include juniper removal to promote native community
diversity. Our results indicate that in the present state, riparian corridors are dominated by Ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei J. Buchholz); however, removal of large juniper alone doesn’t constitute
restoration. Adaptive management including litter dispersal, appropriate herbaceous seed
mixes, invasive species management, and woody species management at lower successional
states is needed to restore functional diversity to these riparian corridors.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
97,Impact of Minimizing Soil Disturbance on Restoring Mesquite Encroached Grasslands,"Woody plant encroachment is one of the greatest contemporary threats to mesic
grasslands of the central United States. Woody encroachment is estimated to result in the loss
of 75% of rangelands by 2040. Fire suppression, overgrazing, and land mismanagement has
resulted in expansive woody plant encroachment throughout Texas. Native Honey mesquite has
become a nuisance within Texas and invasive throughout the world. As percent canopy
composition of Honey mesquite increases so does the density and longevity of annual cool
season grasses resulting in a decrease of native perennial bunch grasses.  This alteration of the
herbaceous layer reduces forage availability for livestock and habitat for wildlife. Additionally,
woody plant encroachment transition of grasslands to shrubland ecosystems imperils grassland-
dwelling bird species populations. This reduction and loss of perennial bunch grasses results in
a decline of suitable habitats for species such as the Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus).
Other bird species are reliant on these grasslands for overwintering habitat. Recommended
restoration treatments for woody plant encroachment include the use of mechanical and
chemical tree removal which could interfere with essential ecosystem services. Additionally, soil
disturbance within grasslands damages roots, modifies soil composition and structure, and has
negative impacts on plant communities. Here we investigate the efficacy of minimizing soil
disturbance on establishing native grass within a Honey mesquite encroached grassland in
central Texas. We hypothesize that native warm-season grasses can be successfully seeded
into the historical grassland ecosystem restoring habitat for grassland-associated bird species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
98,Silver Bluestem as a Catalyst for Restoring Juniper Encroached Grasslands,"Grasslands comprise 20 to 40 percent of earth’s ecosystems and are declining
globally. Grasslands provide essential ecosystems services, are carbon sinks, and provide
habitat for a plethora of wildlife species. Woody plant encroachment transitions grassland
ecosystems to shrublands, impacting soil health and altering plant and wildlife species
composition. Within central Texas, overgrazing, fire suppression, and urban expansion has
enabled native Ashe Juniper to expand beyond its historical niche and encroach on grasslands.
Encroachment of Ashe juniper into these grasslands ecosystems results in a monocultural
landscape through the reduction or elimination of herbaceous layer biodiversity. This loss of
native deep-rooted grasses impacts grassland hydrology, decreasing surface water percolation,
resulting in increased surface water runoff and erosion. Ashe Juniper monoculture is limiting to
the availability of forage, browse, and habitat for wildlife and livestock, creating an understory
comprised of few fibrous rooted plants. Here, we investigate the efficacy of minimizing soil
disturbance during juniper removal and subsequent reintroduction of native grasses using early
successional silver bluestem seeded directly into juniper duff for prairie restoration. We
hypothesize that silver bluestem can germinate and thrive in juniper duff piles, restoring the
herbaceous grass layer and increasing surface water percolation.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
99,Spatial Patterns of Canid Diet and Maternal Haplotype Groups in South Texas,"Red wolves (Canis rufus) are a critically endangered species native to the eastern
United States, but despite conservation efforts, their population size has declined. In recent
years, it was discovered that coyotes (Canis latrans) in the region of Galveston Island, TX
retained red wolf alleles thought lost in the captive-bred population, meaning the two species
had hybridized in the past. This project is currently analyzing the diet of canids (coyotes and
unknown hybrids) in the Galveston region of Texas and assessing the spatial distribution of their
diet components. Canid scat samples were collected around the Galveston Island, TX region
and are being analyzed through DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing to
determine the maternal haplotypes of canids and identify the prey item(s) consumed. The scat
samples are also being analyzed in ArcGIS Pro in order to better understand the spatial
distribution of these canids and determine whether there are any patterns in prey items,
landcover type, and maternal haplotype of the source canid.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
100,Utilization of the Hunt Trap Method to Investigate the Small Mammal Community in an Upland Pine Stand,"Small mammals are important components in forest ecosystems as they can affect
successional and vegetation patterns through their occurrence, diets, and behaviors. In turn,
small mammals can serve as biological indicators of ecosystem quality. Our goal was to test the
effectiveness of the Hunt Trap method in detecting the small mammal community of an upland
pine stand. This trapping technique provides a noninvasive methodology for sampling small
mammal communities. We deployed nine baited Hunt Traps in the Stephen F. Austin
Experimental Forest in Nacogdoches, Texas. Inside the Hunt Trap, we used a Reconyx
HyperFire programmed camera to take a burst of three pictures when motion is detected, with a
one-minute delay before the next detection. Cameras were deployed to record data during
March 2023 (31 days) to observe small mammal occurrences to determine daily activity periods
and the CPUE for any potential detections. Two species (Neotoma floridana and Peromyscus
spp.) of small mammals were detected. The observed species in the genus Peromyscus were
grouped due to the inability to differentiate between species. Nine non-target species were also
detected. Results highlight that small mammal activity periods were greatest from hours 0000 to
0600 and CPUE results showed the highest was Peromyscus spp., while the lowest CPUE was
Neotoma floridana. Our findings suggest that the Hunt trap method can be utilized to evaluate
small mammal in upland pine stands. With further implications of this method management
personnel and researchers can observe species communities to assist in planning future
management practices.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
101,White-Tailed Deer Spatial Ecology in an Agricultural Environment,"Throughout the United States, wildlife species are influenced by many agricultural
factors, including row-crop farming, which can affect prominent species such as white-tailed
deer. Fragmentation from cropland conversion can shift the spatial ecology of white-tailed deer,
thereby influencing life-history characteristics. Movement characteristics of white-tailed deer
vary over the species’ large geographic range; however, region-specific data is necessary for
effective management, especially in areas of dense cropland where species-specific information
is lacking. In the Rolling Plains of Texas, we GPS-collared ten (five female, five male) white-
tailed deer and monitored their movements from November 2014 to March 2017. The mean
home range size was 5.48 km2 (SD=2.91) via dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement models. On
average white-tailed deer spent a moderate (7.5% ± 3.2; x̅ ± SD) amount of time in agriculture
but this varied by sex. Females spent more time in agriculture (10.4% ± 4.0) than males (5.1% ±
3.9). January and February had the greatest mean cropland use (35.7% ± 13.5) while June and
July had the lowest cropland use (0.2% ± 13.5). Individuals generally remained <5 km from
cropland throughout the year (3,000 m ± 2,761), a distance white-tailed deer can easily traverse
multiple times a day. Females used areas closer to cropland (1,431 m ± 6,592) than males
(4,239 m ± 5,341). Our results illustrate that spatial and temporal shifts in movement
characteristics by white-tailed deer may be driven by row-crop farming in this region which could
modify spatial-habitat relationships that can be used to determine future management efforts.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
102,An Assessment of Bird Building Collisions on the University of Texas at San Antonio’s Main Campus,"Bird-building collisions are a top cause of bird mortality in the United States (US).
Because San Antonio, Texas is located prominently in the Central Flyway, incidences of bird-
building collisions are anticipated to be high, especially during migration when the number of
birds is elevated. Despite these ideas, assessments of bird-building collisions in San Antonio
are limited. In response to this missing gap in knowledge, we recorded the presence of bird-
building collisions on the main campus of The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) in
2019, and from January 2021 through December 2023 taking a semi-systematic approach with
emphasis on Spring and Fall migration. We documented 107 birds from 28 species of which the
majority (23 species) were migratory and five are currently considered Species of Greatest
Conservation Need (SGCN) in Texas. Nashville Warbler (Leiothlypis ruficapilla; 14), Orange-
crowned Warbler (Vermivora celata; 11), and Lincoln’s Sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii; 10) were
the most commonly detected species. In support of our prediction, the majority of collisions
occurred during migration (September and October - 71.96%; April - 11.21%). While bird
building collisions occurred throughout campus, two hotspots were revealed; we suggest that
trees nearby serving as roosts coupled with large windows may have elevated collisions at
these locations. Future research incorporating year-round, systematic surveys coupled with
analysis of landscape features will be used to evaluate these ideas. Results from this ongoing
study will be provided to UTSA to encourage adoption of mitigation methods that decrease bird-
building collisions on campus.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
103,Estimating the Proportion of Northern Pintails Available to be Surveyed During the Annual North American Waterfowl Breeding Survey,"Different techniques to estimate animal population parameters can provide differing
and sometimes opposing results. These differences must be accounted for, particularly when
used for management. For example, aerial surveys are used to estimate abundance and
distribution of breeding waterfowl using densities along transects and extrapolating to the larger
target regions located within Western Dakota and Montana. While these surveys efficiently
estimate interannual variability in population distributions they do not explicitly capture highly
dynamic settlement patterns which greatly influence population estimates. Northern pintail
(Anas acuta) breeding distributions depend heavily on highly ephemeral wetlands, therefore
exhibit great annual variability. Our goal is to understand the proportion of pintails within the
survey area during the time of the North American Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat
Survey. We deployed GSM/GPS tracking devices on 665 female pintails wintering throughout
central and western wintering regions of North America (TX/LA Gulf Coast, TX Panhandle, NM,
AZ, and CA) during 2020-2023. Of those marked birds, 244 birds reached their respective
breeding areas, providing us adequate data to use in our analysis. We will use a nonparametric
analysis to assess whether the daily number of pintails per unit area in each survey stratum is
similar to that of non-surveyed areas within the Prairie Pothole Region. We will similarly
compare the number of birds within the belt transects available during the survey period to that
within the target survey area. These comparisons will provide insights into the efficacy of the
breeding survey for northern pintails and potentially refine population estimates.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
104,Spatial and Temporal Responses of Small Cats to the Presence of Big Cat Species in Central Botswana,"As wild cat population trends steadily decline due to habitat loss and ever-growing
human-wildlife conflicts, there is great need for conservation of these species. Wild cat
populations should be studied on both public and private land to gain a deeper understanding of
challenges they face and ways their population numbers could be boosted. We examined the
spatial and temporal overlap in the populations of big and small cats on the Central Kalahari
Game Reserve (national park) and a privately owned, high-fenced hunting property using
camera traps.  From March to June of 2023, we deployed 2 cameras at each of 104 different
sites, with 52 sites per property. Photos were categorized by species and number of individuals
using the program Timelapse, and then exported to an excel file for analysis.  The high-fenced
Bokamoso property experienced about half as many detections as the Central Kalahari Game
Reserve. Caracals (Caracal caracal), servals (Leptailurus serval), and cheetahs (Acinonyx
jubatus) appeared to avoid areas where lions (Panthera leo) and leopards (Panthera pardus)
are present on both properties. However, the African wildcat (Felis lybica), the smallest species
of interest, tended to stay within the area. When similar species avoid one another, it produces
a healthier coexistence by reducing competition among species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
105,Ocelot Dispersion and Guzzler Use on Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge,"Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) conservation at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife
Refuge faces challenges related to man-made water sources (hereafter ‘guzzlers’), which
maintain consistent encounters with ocelots for research. Guzzler maintenance was historically
managed by interns; however, due to budget constraints and the COVID-19 pandemic,
maintenance ceased. Cluster camera surveys to refine the ocelot population estimate were
initiated in early summer 2023 and consistent ocelot encounters have been observed at the
refuge’s water guzzlers. Notably, 3 frequent visitors (2 males, 1 female) were identified at one
guzzler and 2 additional females were observed at another. Inspired by these findings, cameras
were placed at all 13 guzzlers to capture additional instances of ocelot activity, with data
collection underway. During camera checks, we observed that some guzzlers appeared dry or
clogged. This lack of maintenance was concerning because non-functioning guzzlers may
discourage ocelot use. Recently, there have been renewed efforts to maintain guzzlers through
volunteer initiatives. Our research aims to provide data on guzzler utilization by ocelots and
raise awareness about the importance of guzzlers for ocelot conservation. Examining the
connection between guzzler water availability and consistent ocelot visits, potentially
highlighting the correlation between ocelot encounters and areas with functioning guzzlers. Our
study further investigates how guzzler condition affects ocelot dispersal and explores the impact
of supplemental water sources on home range expansion, survival during dispersal, and
connectivity between dispersal areas. Our research contributes essential information to
understanding ocelot behavior around guzzlers and their role in ocelot dispersal, emphasizing
their significance for conservation efforts.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
106,Winter Site Fidelity of Female Northern Pintails Using High-Resolution GPS Data,"Site fidelity is a phenomenon observed in a broad array of species, particularly those
that migrate. Some shorebirds return every year to the same nest cup and wintering site,
whereas some finches are entirely nomadic, following highly dynamic resources across their
range. Waterfowl fall somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. In North America, the northern
pintail (Anas acuta) shows highly-variable winter-site fidelity. However, much of our knowledge
on winter site fidelity relies on band recoveries, which are hindered by often very low recapture
rates. Automated tracking devices that use the cell phone network (GSM) or satellites allow
continuous tracking of animals. These devices provide valuable new insight into distributions of
animals across seasons. Using this technology, we seek to better understand winter site fidelity
of the highly mobile northern pintail. We deployed GPS/GSM tracking devices on 665 female
pintails wintering in the Gulf Coast, Playa Lakes Region, and the Southwest U.S., and a total of
69 individuals returned to wintering areas the year following deployment. We will assess
different levels (spatial scale) of winter site fidelity of pintails using Bhattacharyya’s Affinity Index
to measure degree of overlap of utilization distributions across successive winters, as well as
Euclidean distance between centroids of home ranges between winters. We expect low site
fidelity birds captured in dryer areas (Playa Lakes, Southwest), but higher fidelity in birds
returning to the coastal regions (Texas Coast, Louisiana), due to the latter region’s general
overall stability in wetland availability relative to the former.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
107,Endoparasite Occurrence in Sympatric Bighorn Sheep and Aoudad in the Trans- Pecos Region of Texas,"Population decline of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) in the Trans-
Pecos ecoregion of Texas is a subject of burgeoning concern for wildlife biologists.  In many
parts of their range, much of this decline is in part caused by mortalities and reduced
recruitment from exotic pathogens originally introduced to free-ranging ungulates by domestic
livestock.  Additionally, aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), an invasive Caprid originating from Africa,
may facilitate the spread of pathogens that can cross species barriers, such as certain
endoparasites.  Determining parasite species presence and abundance in sympatric bighorn
and aoudad using techniques such as fecal egg counts (FEC) is the first step in exploring this
possibility.  We used the modified McMaster technique, which is the most commonly utilized
method to quantify parasite load in ruminants, and the Wisconsin technique to quantify parasite
presence.  Fecal samples were obtained from 22 bighorn and 13 aoudad captured in the Black
Gap Wildlife Management Area and Big Bend Ranch State Park in October-November 2023,
where 82% of bighorn samples and 54% of aoudad samples contained at least one species of
endoparasite.  Three genera were detected in both bighorn and aoudad combined, where
Ascaris ovis, a form of roundworm, and other ascarids were frequently observed in both
species.  Other parasites observed in both bighorn and aoudad included Eimeria spp. and
strongyle-type species.  These preliminary results support the notion that a larger, more
comprehensive study of gastrointestinal parasite occurrence in these species may be
warranted, especially as aoudad densities continue to rise.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
108,Effect of Weather and Urbanization on the Activity of Virginia Opossums in the US,"Urbanization affects wildlife, but each species reacts differently to urbanization.
Research has found that mesopredators avoid highly urbanized areas while benefiting from
urban resources simultaneously.  Additionally, studies show that Virginia opossums (Didelphis
virginiana) are more active in areas with steady precipitation. With this in mind, we hypothesized
that Virginia opossums would be more active in urban areas and areas with a higher mean
precipitation. For the methodology, we used publicly available Snapshot USA data that gathered
camera data from locations across the US. Our anthropogenic covariates included cultivated
land and wild vegetation, and our weather covariates included precipitation and minimum
temperature. The calculated p-values from our study were: 2019 mean precipitation (p=0.024),
2020 mean precipitation (p=1.01e-07), for 2019 wild vegetation (p=0.0001), 2020 wild
vegetation (p=0.004), 2020 minimum temperature (p=3.28e-05), and 2020 cultivated land (p=

precipitation, minimum temperature, and cultivated land, and negatively correlated with wild

the activity of Virginia opossums.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
109,Factors Influencing Diets of Wild Pigs,"Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are one of the most damaging invasive species worldwide,
given their high reproductive potential, large size, and omnivorous diet. Their rapid expansion
has increased concerns for disease transmission, impacts on agriculture production, and effects
on ecosystems. If not properly managed, wild pigs could cause extensive, possibly irreversible,
damage to native ecosystems. My goal is to document the diet composition of wild pigs in the
Neches River Basin of the Piney Woods region of Texas seeking to make specific inference
about factors influencing changes in diet among animals throughout the year to determine
influence of environmental factors throughout each calendar season, determine influence of age
and sex on diets, and determine the influence of parasite presence on diets. I am collecting a
minimum of 10 specimens per season for sample collection of ectoparasites, feces, and
stomach contents from each wild pig harvested. All samples will be processed in order to
identify the abundance of parasites from each individual, identify items consumed, and
abundance of each food type consumed. These findings will then be used for analysis to
determine if any significant associations of any combined relationships exist. Understanding the
feeding habits in combination with possible factors influencing those habits may increase the
success of management plans. If any significant correlations can be found, these results can be
implemented into the timing of management efforts across the area creating more efficient
success for those wanting to decrease and manage wild pig populations to reduce ecological
and economic impacts.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
110,"Fire Suppression Chemicals: Use, Effectiveness and Perceptions The Testing of EarthClean TetraKO™","Wildland fire suppression chemicals (defined as any additive to water used to
improve effectiveness as an extinguishing agent such as foams, retardants, and water
enhancers) have a long history of use in wildland firefighting. Since their introduction in the
1930s, phosphate-based chemicals have been utilized in wildfire suppression strategies. In
recent years, 50 million gallons of chemical fire retardant have been used to fight wildfires
annually. A major issue posed by the use of most suppression chemicals is their concentration
and accumulation in the environment post-burn. The toxicity of common suppression chemicals
has been well documented and known to cause harm to soils and waterways. With recent
increases in fire activity and intensity, the demand for safer, more environmentally friendly
suppression chemicals will rise. Newer “biodegradable” suppression chemicals, such as
TetraKO™, advertise themselves as environmentally friendly alternatives to the phosphate-
based agents commonly used today. In this study, we test TetraKO™, a cornstarch-based
product, under four replicated application conditions to evaluate its effectiveness and
performance. We hypothesize that TetraKO™ will stop the advance of fire more often than
water alone, even after a drying period. Additionally the non-toxic component reduces post-burn
negative impacts on the environment from suppression operations. Perceptions of wildland fire
suppression chemical use may be drastically improved if “safe”, “eco-friendly” products were
highly effective as control lines and water additives for suppression. Pending the results of this
study, a successful performance of biodegradable suppression chemicals would make a new
tool available to land managers, particularly in sensitive ecosystems.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
111,Illuminating Painted Bunting breeding season diets at Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area using fecal eDNA metabarcoding,"Of the two breeding populations in the United States, the western Painted Bunting
(Passerina ciris) population is comparatively understudied. As this species’ populations are
declining, gaining a more comprehensive view of habitat requirements on breeding grounds is
needed. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the diet of Painted Buntings breeding in North Texas at
Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (Denton Co., TX) to illuminate the food resources
needed by this population. Painted Bunting diets were last analyzed over 100 years ago using
lethal sampling methods, whereas technological advances now enable use of non-invasive
methods, like fecal eDNA metabarcoding. Despite growing interest in this approach, it has been
used relatively infrequently for birds compared to mammals. We non-invasively collected feces
from Painted Buntings across all three periods of the 2023 breeding season (pre-nesting,
breeding/nesting, and post-breeding) for diet analysis. We predicted that more arthropods are
consumed during the breeding season, a pattern that would be most pronounced in females,
and that during the post-breeding period more seeds would be found in the diet. This diet
assessment will not only expand and refine foundational information for this species, but also
provide invaluable habitat use data for the management of Painted Buntings in Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
112,Evaluating the Effect of Origin and Super-Stocking Methods on the Genetics of Eastern Wild Turkey,"In the early 1900’s, wild turkey populations were nearly extirpated from North
America due largely to unregulated hunting. Even after the implementation of hunting
restrictions, Eastern Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) populations in eastern Texas
struggled to recover. The Texas Parks & Wildlife Department has recently adopted a novel
translocation strategy known as super-stocking that involves simultaneously releasing ~80 wild
birds of mixed origin at each site. According to preliminary data, birds sourced from Texas
represented 61% of total super-stocked birds, Iowa represented 8.7%, and nine other states
accounted for the remaining 30.3%. Our aim was to determine if super-stock sources exert
influence on the current genetic diversity of M. silvestris in eastern Texas. According to
anecdotal evidence, birds trapped in some states may be contributing more to the current
population of M. silvestris than others and the genetic composition of a super-stocked
population may influence its ability to establish in an area. Genetic analysis will be performed on
eDNA samples from contemporary and release populations to determine the genetic
contribution of each source to the current population. Our findings will inform the selection of
future super-stocking sources and improved land management practices that facilitate dispersal,
survival, and reproductive success.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
113,Response of Female Northern Pintail to Thermal Variation During Spring Migration,"Dynamic climatic conditions during spring migration add additional costs to birds
already under selective pressure to maximize fitness by optimizing time and energy. Increasing
metabolic rate due to cold or hot temperatures adds physiological costs. Energy expended to
respond to these costs can further compound energetic stress throughout daily and seasonal
movements. Compounding energetic costs have implications for subsequent fitness. Under
predicted climate change, increasing incidence of extreme weather events and warming trends
will increase the importance of temperature variability during migration as a dynamic energetic
factor. The northern pintail (Anas acuta) arrives earlier than most ducks to breed in the Prairie
Pothole Region, likely pushing its thermal limits. However, pintails also show shifting migration
phenology related to spring warming trends. Our first objective is to model how female northern
pintails respond to temperature-induced metabolic costs via their activity patterns during spring
migration at hourly, daily, and seasonal scales. We then will predict the effects of climate
change on pintails’ migratory activity budgets at multiple scales. Female pintails wintering in the
US Gulf Coast, Playa Lakes and Southwest Regions were fitted with GSM GPS/ACC
transmitters from 2019-2023. Under a generalized additive modeling framework, we will
determine the relationship between temperature-linked existence metabolism and overall
dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) given the interaction of spatial, temporal, and demographic
covariates. This multi-scale approach will provide a more mechanistic understanding of
waterfowl migration energetics in relation to climatic conditions, and will be informative for
waterfowl management under future climate change.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
114,"Space Use, Movement, and Survival of Translocated Desert Bighorn Sheep in Sonora, Mexico","Mountain sheep abundance across North America has declined >60% from historic
times. In response, state and federal agencies have conducted >1,000 reintroduction projects,
translocating >21,000 bighorn sheep. Despite these efforts, ~50% of reintroductions are
considered unsuccessful, leading researchers to stress the importance of post-release
monitoring on the overall success of future reintroductions. Our objectives were to quantify
space use, movement, and survival of translocated desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis
mexicana). We conducted our research in the Sierra El Alamo Mountains, ~45 km W of
Caborca, in northwestern Sonora, Mexico. We captured and fitted 16 bighorn sheep (9 females,
7 male) with GPS collars, which collected 1 GPS fix every 3 hours starting in November 2023.
We created monthly 95% Brownian bridge movement models (BBMM), calculated monthly
distance travelled, and used the Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate survival. Monthly home
range size for females was greatest in April (1,319 ha) and least in September (291 ha).
Similarly, for males, home range size was greatest in February (1,533 ha) and least in October
(513 ha). Cumulatively, movement was greatest from April through June (~49 km) for females
and from February through April (~52 km) for males; movement was least in October and
December for both sexes. Annual survival (November 2023 to November 2024) was 81%
(13/16) for both sexes. Early post-monitoring data suggest the reintroduction effort was
successful because annual survival was high, and reintroduced sheep joined herds with native
sheep and settled into the study area quickly.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
115,Movement and foraging ecology of south Texas mountain lions (Puma concolor),"Anthropogenic structures, such as fences, walls, or highways, can have profound
influences on wildlife populations via fragmented habitats, impeded movement, and genetic
isolation. These structural barriers affect populations of large mammals worldwide, yet few
studies have quantified barrier impacts. Such research is particularly pressing considering the
construction of the ~1500km border barrier-system separating the United States and México.
We will conduct one of the first evaluations of the potential impacts of the U.S.-México border
barrier-system on movement and foraging ecology of a large carnivore, the mountain lion (Puma
concolor). Objectives are to assess effects of the border barrier-system on 1) transboundary
movements, 2) diet composition and kill rates, and 3) cause-specific mortality. We will capture at
least 20 lions and fit them with GPS collars equipped with geofencing that initiates high-fix rates
near the border. We will conduct integrated step selection and barrier behavior analyses to
examine the effects of the border on selection and movement. We will quantify diet through kill-
site investigations and DNA metabarcoding of scat samples. We will monitor survival and
cause-specific mortality by conducting mortality investigations. The broader implications of this
project are sizable, as Texas is the only state in the U.S. where mountain lions are not formally
managed and considered non-game. Additionally, population trends have not been tracked and
this population exists alongside a formidable anthropogenic barrier. By investigating the effects
of the U.S.-México border on a wide-ranging carnivore, we can inform mitigation and
management strategies locally and provide inference for at-risk carnivore populations globally.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
116,Preliminary Field Data and Proposed Experiments for Evaluating Efficacy and the Detection Limits of Alligator Snapping Turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) Environmental DNA (eDNA),"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is a large freshwater turtle
native to the southeastern United States.  Due to declining populations across its range, the
species is a candidate for listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.  Its range
extends into East Texas, but detailed information on its status in Texas is limited due to its
cryptic behavior and low detectability.  Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a valuable tool in
determining the presence of rare or cryptic species, particularly in aquatic environments.
Previous efforts suggest that eDNA surveys may be a useful tool to detect alligator snapping
turtles, but these studies were limited in temporal scope.  Here we present preliminary field data
for the first three-month sampling period of sites where alligator snapping turtles are known to
occur.  These preliminary data will aid in evaluating the efficacy of eDNA sampling across a
temporal scale, with the complete data set allowing for seasonal analyses.  We also present
proposed mesocosm experiments to examine how water quality within an aquatic system (e.g.,
flow rate, temperature, pH, and turbidity) may influence the detection efficacy of alligator
snapping turtle eDNA.  Controlled laboratory experiments will be used to evaluate detection
limits as might be influenced by eDNA concentration and exposure to changes in temperature
and pH.  Results from this study will inform researchers on the potential utility and limitation for
eDNA detection in monitoring alligator snapping turtles and other cryptic species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
117,Ocelot Reproduction and Kitten Survival in South Texas,"Estimation of vital rates, including reproduction, is critical to understanding complex
population dynamics, particularly for small, declining populations. Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis)
are a federally-listed species whose current range in the United States is restricted to two small,
isolated populations in South Texas. Our proposed research will aim to elucidate three key data
gaps for ocelots in the United States: (1) first-year survival rates of ocelots; (2) timing and
frequency of ocelot reproductive events; and (3) drivers of ocelot den site selection, with the
goal of informing an integrated population model (IPM) to guide ocelot recovery. We aim to
place expandable radio-linked VHF (rVHF) collars on ocelot kittens to assess first-year survival.
The kittens’ rVHF collars communicate with the mothers’ GPS collar periodically to update
neonate status as nearby, absent, or deceased. These data will be analyzed in a Cormack-
Jolly-Seber model in a Bayesian framework. Multivariate linear regression will be utilized to
assess what factors (e.g., season, rainfall, vegetation cover, mother's age, mother’s number of
previous litters) affect reproductive timing and frequency. A resource selection framework will be
applied to analyze what factors (e.g., patch configuration, vegetation composition, and human-
related factors such as distance from road) influence den establishment, and if those factors
differ, what influences overall habitat selection. Providing insights into first-year ocelot survival
will directly inform an integrated population model to guide ocelot recovery in the United States.
In addition, knowing what factors are associated with reproductive timing and den site selection
will guide ongoing, large-scale restoration of Tamaulipan thornscrub.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
118,Avian and Vegetation Response to Grassland Restoration in the Texas Cross Timbers Ecoregion,"Woody and invasive plant encroachment in grasslands is a major cause of grassland
bird population declines in North America. In the Cross Timbers ecoregion, Ashe juniper
(Juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), King Ranch bluestem (Bothriochloa
ischaemum) and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) convert native grasslands into dense shrublands
and monocultures that are unsuitable for obligate grassland bird species such as grasshopper
sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum). Our objective is to assess the impact of restoration on
the avian community by comparing avian abundance and plant community composition, canopy
cover, and density across time. Our study area is in Palo Pinto Mountains State Park in
northcentral Texas. We will conduct vegetation surveys during April and September with
fourteen 100m line transects using quadrat sampling for herbaceous species and the line
intercept method for woody species for 3 years, including pre- and post-restoration. Bird surveys
will be conducted for 4 periods/year using eight 20x100m line transects and 4 point counts
spaced >200m apart for 3 years. We plan to remove woody and invasive species and reseed at
an 8-ha upland section in early 2024. We have collected preliminary vegetation data in July
2023 and will collect preliminary bird data in early December 2023. This project will supplement
an ongoing 8-year riparian restoration project at the state park, provide songbird habitat,
improve surface water capture and nutrient cycling, and provide a demonstration site of cost-
effective ecosystem restoration and land management practices.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
119,Using Targeted Poisoning of Red Imported Fire Ants to Improve Texas Horned Lizard Habitat,"The spread of red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta; RIFA) has frequently been
cited as a factor contributing to the decline of the Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum;
THL). Two hypotheses for this are: 1) direct lizard mortality due to RIFA, and 2) displacement of
THL’s main food source, harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex spp.), by RIFA. A new third hypothesis
suggests that the invasion of RIFA could be causing a decline in hatchling THL food resources,
as their diet is mainly composed of small ant species. Many studies have attempted widespread
treatment to eradicate RIFA; however, this could have unintended consequences for non-target
ant species that THL depend on. Using a targeted application method, we sought to reduce
RIFA populations over the summers of 2022 and 2023 at four sites located at Mason Mountain
Wildlife Management in central Texas, a locality with an ongoing THL reintroduction program. At
each site, hot dog baits were placed 5 meters apart in 10x10 grids. At treatment sites, one
teaspoon of Amdro (a common ant poison) was applied to baits with RIFA thirty minutes after
placement. After Amdro was applied, baits were left for 30 minutes and then collected.
Treatments were repeated monthly May – August. The effects of each targeted poisoning were
evaluated using pitfall traps and ant abundance measurements from baits. Results showed no
clear trends in RIFA and hatchling food abundance over time. This suggests that our minimal
approach to targeted poisoning was not enough to significantly reduce RIFA activity at our sites.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
120,Nutritive Value Dynamics and Strategic Supplementation of White-tailed Deer Browse Species in the Southern Cross Timbers and Prairies of Texas,"In the Southern Cross Timbers and Prairies Region of Texas, white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus) are both a recreationally and economically valuable resource. Though
nutritional value influences selection, forage availability tends to be the major limiting factor of
high-quality diet selection. Forage nutritive value and availability, however, varies among and
within growing seasons, as well as among years. The intent of this work is to evaluate how
commonly used supplementation regimens (i.e., whole corn, cotton seed meal, and alfalfa)
affect the digestion of first and second choice browse species relative to no supplementation on
a seasonal basis. Starting in January 2023, seasonal browse samples were collected from a
ranch located near Cross Plains, TX. Browse samples of six different species (chittamwood,
elbowbush, winged elm, post oak, live oak, and skunkbush) were collected from two different
ecological sites, loamy bottomland and clay loam. Nutritional constituents of browse samples
were determined, including crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber
(ADF), lignin, and fat. Ruminal digestibility was estimated using in vitro true digestibility
methodology (IVTDMD), with all species within an ecosite being incubated concurrently with
each supplement.  There was an interaction of species and season for NDF and ADF (P <
0.01), with both following the same relative trend within a species. There was an interaction of
species and season, as well as an effect of supplement for IVTDMD (P < 0.05). Browse nutrient
availability and IVDMD changed seasonally with the greatest digestibility and least fibrous
constituents in the spring and summer.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
121,Tree Species Identity or Forest Structure: Restoration Implications for Small Mammal Diversity in Southern Pine Forests,"Industrial forest management practices converted historic native pine species forests
(e.g., shortleaf pine [Pinus echinata]) to homogenous, high-density plantations consisting of
native off-site species (e.g., loblolly pine [Pinus taeda]). Restoration efforts have been aimed at
converting these sites back to historical upland pine forests utilizing species that were more
commonly found in the site, which typically integrates one of two approaches: 1) a conversion
strategy, which involves replacing off-site species with preferred historic pine species, but this
approach can be fairly intensive and costly, or 2) the retention strategy which emphasizes forest
structure over species identity and is more gradual and less intrusive on the landscape.
However, the impact of each of these restoration strategies on small mammal diversity is not
well understood. We sought to determine the relative strengths of two factors (pine species
identity vs. forest structural characteristics) on an ecosystem service (support of biodiversity).
Specifically, using Hunt camera traps, we recorded small mammal occurrences across six
treatments that differed in tree species composition (monoculture forests of loblolly pine,
monoculture forests of shortleaf pine, or mixed shortleaf-loblolly pine forests) and covariates
that measure forest structure from two treatments (understory mulched or unmulched). We
found that covariates describing forest structure was a stronger predictor of small mammal
community composition (species richness and structure) as compared to pine species identity.
These results suggest a retention, rather than a conversion, approach to restoration can still
support biodiversity in forest ecosystems while achieving restoration objectives.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
122,Effects of Prescribed Fire on Herbaceous Nearest-Neighbor Relationships,"Fire has played a crucial role in shaping and maintaining plant communities in Texas
rangelands for centuries. However, the absence of periodic fire in fire-adapted ecosystems has
caused significant shifts in vegetation composition. While previous studies in rangelands have
explored the impact of prescribed fire on various herbaceous vegetation aspects, there is a
notable research gap regarding the effects of prescribed fire on relationships between nearest-
neighboring plants. Our research addresses this gap by evaluating how different prescribed fire
regimes, characterized by varied return intervals and burning seasons, influence interactions
among herbaceous plants in the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes ecoregion of South Texas.
Our study was conducted at the East Foundation's El Sauz ranch, where sixteen burn units
(>200 hectares) were randomly assigned either winter, summer, or control (no burn) treatments
at either short (3 years) or long (5 years) return intervals in 2016. We conduct six modified step-
point transects per burn unit pre-burning, ~6, ~12, ~18, and ~24 months post-burning, and in
control units concurrently. Transects capture ground cover, nearest herbaceous plant species,
nearest rooted neighboring herbaceous species, and the distance between the two plants.
Preliminary data indicate that significant positive associations are found more frequently during
summer sampling than during winter sampling. Additionally, there is an increase in total
significant positive associations in burn plots following fire. The research findings will provide
insights for land managers, aiding in the development of precise prescribed burning
prescriptions to meet specific management objectives.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
123,Patterns of Microhabitat Use by Texas Tortoises in a Southern Texas Coastal Rangeland,"Understanding habitat relationships at multiple scales aids in producing effective
management recommendations for wildlife species. For example, macrohabitat associations
can be useful in conducting species surveys across a broader geographic range, while
assessing microhabitat associations examines more specific resource use and has utility in
forming site management plans. Limited research exists on such relationships for the Texas
tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri), a species listed as threatened in Texas, where it ranges in the
southern portion of the state. Generally, Texas tortoises are known to use thornscrub grassland
vegetation. However, thornscrub grassland is a broad term that does not describe the finer
scale variation in vegetation class cover within this vegetation community across space. We
attached radio transmitters to Texas tortoises and assessed their microhabitat associations on a
coastal rangeland in southern Texas to determine more detailed patterns of resource use. We
examined the vegetation cover types and overall canopy cover at 1m above ground used by
tortoises at the East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch in Kenedy and Willacy Counties. We collected
microhabitat data at 253 tortoise locations, along with 2 random locations for each tortoise
location (506 random locations) to compare microhabitat use to availability. Texas tortoises
appear to use areas with higher overall canopy cover and woody vegetation cover than is
generally available, although they exhibit use of a variety of vegetation cover types. These finer
scale assessments of Texas tortoise microhabitat use are necessary to inform
recommendations for management action throughout their range to support their conservation.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
124,Microclimate Influence on Sound Propagation in a Woody-Grassland Mosaic,"Sound plays a pivotal role in shaping animals’ understanding of their environment
and dictating their responses, particularly with regard to communication. The acoustic
adaptation hypothesis posits that organisms structure their calls to optimize propagation within
their local environment. Factors influencing transmission of sound in terrestrial landscapes
include temperature, humidity, and vegetation structure. With the onset of climate change, these
factors are undergoing shifts from their historical conditions, which may lead to changes in local
soundscapes. Moreover, within the Great Plains, USA, significant alterations to abiotic
conditions and ecosystem processes have led to woody plant encroachment (WPE) within
grasslands, compounding changes in microclimate patterns across scales. It is likely that higher
temperatures and increased woody vegetation structure are lowering the detectability of sounds
and increasing attenuation rates. Thus, we sought to identify how variation in these factors are
impacting sound transmission in a woody-grassland mosaic. Beginning in Fall 2023, sounds will
be propagated and recorded along transects in grassland and juniper-encroached areas. Sound
propagation will occur across four different temperature ranges to capture thermal variation
across seasons. Experimental removal of woody vegetation will be conducted to quantify
changes in propagation under simulated management scenarios. Vegetation structure will be
measured along each of the transects before and after vegetation removal. Impacts of
temperature, canopy structure, and the interaction of these two factors on sound transmission
will be determined. Results will help highlight expected changes on soundscapes of the Great
Plains within the auspices of WPE and climate change pressures.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
125,Is Detectability of Texas Tortoises Affected by Time of Day or Temperature?,"Texas tortoises (Gopherus berlandieri) are a state threatened species in Texas that
has experienced sharp declines in population number, and its distribution has become sporadic.
Because of their decline, conservation agencies desire to enumerate remaining populations;
however, low abundance and unknown detectability make this difficult.  Therefore, we built a 2.4
ha enclosure, translocated 56 Texas tortoises into the enclosure, conducted weekly line
transects during morning, afternoon, and evening from July – September 2023, recorded
temperature and all tortoises observed, and calculated the percent of tortoises observed and
their detectability from the known number of tortoises within the enclosure. No differences
(F2,49 < 0.55, P > 0.57) were observed in number or percent of tortoises recorded, or
detectability between the 3 time periods.  Average detectability for Texas tortoises was 0.17.  An
inverse relationship, which was not affected (F2,46 = 0.97, P = 0.39) by time of day, was
detected between number of tortoises observed and temperature (F1,46 = 13.6, P = 0.0006).
Therefore, Texas tortoises could be surveyed anytime during diurnal hours, but it is
recommended to survey during the coolest time of the day in summer months.  Tortoises were
most active when temperatures were <29 C (85oF).",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
126,Prevalence and Treatment of Mycoplasma in Texas Tortoises,"The Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) is a threatened species in Texas whose
population numbers and distribution have declined. A potential mortality factor of tortoises is
upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), which is caused by bacterial species of the genus
Mycoplasma. The disease causes a range of symptoms including nasal discharge, swollen
eyelids, lethargy, and a general failure to thrive. Recent research suggests that these bacteria
have a commensal relationship with their tortoise hosts but that additional stress on tortoises
could alter their immune system, which can lead to infection. Our objectives were to collect
serum and whole blood samples from Texas tortoises located in the Rio Grande Valley (N =
171) and in coastal southern Texas (N = 23) to determine the prevalence of mycoplasma via
serology and PCR cultures, and to determine a protocol to treat mycoplasma symptoms in
exposed Texas tortoises. We tested the recommended dosages and administration of
tulathromycin and oxytetracycline, along with saline-injected symptomatic and healthy tortoises.
We found a 33% (64/194) prevalence rate for mycoplasma among tortoises with no difference
between areas of southern Texas.  Titers ranged from 1:32-128.  PCR was unable to detect
bacteria in any tortoise.  Neither antibiotic treatment improved the general health of symptomatic
tortoises; however, handling appeared to exacerbate mycoplasma symptoms in tortoises,
possibly to due to increased stress.  It is important to determine disease prevalence prior to
translocation efforts to avoid the undesirable consequence of introducing a disease to a novel
population.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
127,Linking Soil Moisture with Photosynthetic Activity with Very High-Resolution Imagery,"Water plays a vital role in the overall performance of native rangeland species. Water
stress due to drought causes stomata closure in plant species to minimize water loss and
reduce leaves' photosynthetic rate. Limited soil water can affect productivity and have an impact
on plant diversity. Limited water availability within plant species consequently has a negative
effect on plant diversity, and overall native plant health. Further, limited water availability can
result in lower forage quantity and quality, thus impacting domestic livestock and native wildlife
as they compete for available plant resources. Overgrazing inhibits the growth of palatable plant
species with high nutritional value which leads to stunted growth and plant stress. Plant stress
can be observed through remote sensing platforms. Our objective is to use multispectral
sensors on drones to monitor rangeland species and their spectral reflectance changes based
on water availability. We plan to fly drones 50 m above ground level and acquire multispectral
imagery for 3 species: Slender Grama (Bouteloua repens), Pink Pappusgrass (Pappophprum
Bicolor), and Seacoast Bluestem (Schizachyrium Littorale) at the Texas Native Seeds fields at
Texas A&M University- Kingsville during the 2024 growing season. Soil and leaf moisture
sensors will be used to compare field collected data and aerial imagery. Plant tissue samples
after each flight will help to determine the relationship between nutrient analysis and reflectance
values from hyperspectral imagery. This study will provide new insights on the relationship
between soil moisture, nutritional content, leaf moisture, and reflectance values of native
grasses in South Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
128,Exploring Temporal Variability in the Scale of Effect for a Declining Ground-Nesting Bird in an Anthropogenically Altered Landscape.,"In a rapidly changing and heterogenous world, organisms must often respond to
multiple pressures at different spatial and temporal scales. The scale of effect can represent the
scale at which a landscape variable has the strongest impact on the organism’s response, and
organisms are expected to have disparate responses to variables across different spatio-
temporal scales. In semi-arid systems, resources and conditions frequently change in
abundance, distribution, and severity based on, but not limited to, climatic patterns. Additionally,
these systems have increasingly become altered by anthropogenic activity that may functionally
alter the ecosystem. In South Texas, chestnut-bellied scaled quail (Callipepla squamata
castanogastris; hereafter: “quail”) populations have experienced distribution-wide population
declines in recent decades. These populations are also cyclical in nature where the population
will change dramatically annually in response to environmental factors. This large interannual
variability can make determining what is driving long-term population trends difficult. Therefore,
it is important to explore both population trends concurrently by exploring variation in the scale
of effect across multiple temporal scales. We will use 38-years of quail abundance data
collected from the Breeding Bird Survey and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s annual
quail surveys, along with landscape data from the Rangeland Analysis Platform to assess
variation in the scale of effect for landscape dynamics across a broad temporal extent (decades)
within fine temporal grains (interannual variation). Results will illustrate the spatiotemporal
dynamics of scale of effect within a landscape increasingly altered and fragmented by
anthropogenic activity for a culturally important gamebird.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
129,An Examination of Wildlife Characteristics Related to Risk of Entanglement in Mesh Products,"Road infrastructure is expanding across the United States, and these construction
projects typically involve a large volume of soil cut and fill. Contractors utilize erosion control
products (ECPs) to reduce soil erosion and improve plant growth. These products include mesh
erosion control blankets (ECBs) with the concern of potential entanglement to wildlife taxa;
however, few studies have focused on determining the level of risk ECPs pose to wildlife.
Specifically, few products have been evaluated for their risk of entangling wildlife. The objective
of this review was to determine the physical characteristics of wildlife and the properties of mesh
products that increase the likelihood of wildlife entanglement or mortality. We performed a
review of studies and accounts referencing wildlife entanglement or mortality in ECBs and other
mesh products. Previous studies and accounts have mainly involved snakes, followed by turtles,
and including a few reports involving amphibians, lizards, birds, and small mammals. Several
reports involved species listed as threatened or endangered. Body and limb size, mesh size and
inflexibility, and animal behaviors have been found to be potentially important factors in the
likelihood of entanglement. This review is part of a larger study that aims to provide the basis to
test and rank materials and identify effective, biodegradable ECPs that reduce entanglement
risk to wildlife.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
130,Estimating Waterfowl Density and Species Richness using Autonomous Recording Units,"Sanctuaries (i.e., non-hunted wetlands) are important for waterfowl during the hunting
season and have been shown to increase local waterfowl abundance and diversity. The Texas
Coast Waterfowl Sanctuary Program, created by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, strives
to enroll private wetland sites to serve as waterfowl sanctuaries in areas with high hunting
pressure. Traditional waterfowl survey techniques introduce potential biases and disturbance
due to observer presence. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) have become increasingly
common in avian research, but have not yet been used to estimate density of waterfowl. Our
objective is to develop a standardized protocol for estimating species richness and density of
waterfowl using ARUs for eventual comparisons between sanctuaries and hunted wetlands.
During phase 1, we performed playbacks along transects, recording climatic conditions and
broadcasting a sequence of vocalizations from 10 waterfowl species and pure tones at varying
distances from an ARU and human observer. Data collected from transects will be used to
quantify acoustic modulation in wetlands and allow for corrections to estimated waterfowl
density during future field deployment of ARUs. For phase 2, during winters ’23 and ‘24 we will
deploy 60 ARUs in paired sanctuary and hunted wetlands at public and privately-owned
properties along the Texas Midcoast. We will use BirdNET, a machine learning platform, to
create a classifier which we will evaluate for accuracy and use to process field recordings. Our
study will establish a protocol for passive acoustic monitoring of waterfowl in wetland
environments and inform strategic placement of sanctuaries in future years.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
131,Understanding Disease Transmission Dynamics in a Multi-felid System,"Wildlife disease mediated by the introduction of feral species can seriously impact
resident animal populations.   Understanding disease dynamics and potential spillover pathways
is important to safeguard populations of conservation value.  South Texas is the only location
where federally endangered ocelots (Leopardis pardalis) exist within the United States.  One
population exists in proximity to an urban area where feral domestic animals, specifically, cats
(Felis catus), are present, leaving ocelot populations exposed to potential disease spillovers.
Ocelots in South Texas are habitat specialists and live in Tamaulipan thornscrub, but spatially
overlap with bobcats (Lynx rufus), which are a generalist species that span urban and natural
landscapes.  This research will investigate the possibility that bobcats could spatially connect
ocelots to domestic cats, which may act as disease reservoirs.  Our focus is two-fold: (1) to
determine the directionality of disease transmission using genomic assessment of a common
feline virus (Feline Foamy Virus), and (2) to estimate contact rates of ocelots, bobcats, and
domestic cats and infer disease transmission risk.  We hypothesize that, due to known spatial
dynamics, bobcats  are the mediator species in disease transmission from feral cats to ocelots.
A greater understanding of disease dynamics among ocelots and sympatric species is crucial to
making management decisions relevant to ocelot recovery. Additionally, given the presence of
feral cats worldwide, understanding the role of feral cats in disease transmission has global
conservation implications.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
132,Investigating Patterns of Alligator Nest Site Selection and Nest Depredation by Wild Pigs,"Crocodilians worldwide are the subject of intense conservation efforts. Many species
have declined, and/or been rendered extirpated or extinct. Others have experienced notable
successes. The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is often thought of as a significant
example of successful crocodilian conservation and management practices. It is important to
continue to understand and monitor the species as threats of habitat loss and invasive species
are on the rise. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are one such invasive species that are a threat to
ecosystems, biodiversity, and native wildlife populations. Wild pig populations are expanding
across the United States. Depredation of alligator nests by wild pigs can negatively impact
alligators, yet the patterns of this depredation and the impacts on alligator reproductive success
are not understood. It is unknown how the probability of depredation by wild pigs varies in
relation to different habitat characteristics and selection of alligator nest sites. I will assess
habitat characteristics such as surrounding vegetation, distance to high human activity areas,
salinity, and soil type as well as whether the nest was built on a bank, levee, ditch, open marsh,
or island. Then I will assess if there is a correlation between the alligator nest habitat
characteristics and depredation by wild pigs.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
133,Are Native Grasses Pollinated by Insects?,"Pollinators play a vital role in all terrestrial ecosystems. We know from prior research
that they save the US economy an estimated 39.2 billion dollars every year by pollinating
agricultural crops and reducing the need for mechanical pollination. They also sustain
ecosystems by pollinating the vegetation, aiding in reproduction, which cannot be given a dollar
value. However, we do not yet know the extent of all the plant species they affect. This study is
aimed at filling information gaps regarding native grass pollination. We will be investigating the
relationships that insect pollinators may have with native grasses of southern Texas. We have
chosen to focus on ten native grass species which are widespread throughout the region and
have a variety of flowering structures. We are conducting this study at the Texas Native Seeds
facility in Kingsville, Texas. Plots of each focal species are established on bedded rows in
monotypic stands, and five individuals of each species were randomly chosen for observation.
We are recording the duration of available pollen resources the native grasses provide, and
which insects take advantage of these resources. Additionally, we are tracking the
morphological changes of the grasses’ inflorescences and determining whether various stages
of inflorescence attract insect pollinators. Field observations have shown that rainfall might have
a positive correlation to morphological changes and availability of pollen resources.
Understanding the relationships of pollinators with the native grass pollen resources will allow
us to better manage the native grasses to support them.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
134,"Owl Community Structure, Resource Partitioning, and Exposure to Second- Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticides.","As a taxonomic group, owls are some of the poorest understood avian species in
North America due to their nocturnal behavior. Even less is understood regarding overlap,
exclusion, or resource partitioning within multi-species owl communities. This is an especially
relevant issue due to the widespread use of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides
(SGAR) and the frequency in which these compounds are implicated in secondary poisoning of
raptor species. My study objectives are to determine owl species-specific densities, assess
nesting habitat associations, spatial distributions, and extent of overlap of owl species on the
Welder Wildlife Refuge and other areas. I will use passive audio monitoring (PAM) and call
playback methods to locate areas occupied by owls, then use ground searches for nest
locations and subsequent productivity monitoring, then conduct nesting habitat assessments
and extent of overlap of owl species. Additionally, I will assess prevalence of exposure by owls
to SGARs across protected and unprotected landscapes by collecting and comparing blood
samples from captured adult owls and those submitted to regional wildlife rehabilitation facilities.
By systematically collecting these combined data, a clearer understanding of the owl community
structure, resource partitioning, and productivity within the coastal bend region of Texas can be
obtained, along with an understanding of the distribution of occurrence and prevalence of SGAR
exposure across the landscapes.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
135,A Passive Integrated Transponder Tag Antenna Array for Tracking Small Mammals,"Although tracking technology has largely been miniaturized, size, weight, and battery
lifespan are still limitations with both radio and satellite telemetry for small animals. These
limitations can lead to poor spatial and temporal resolution of the data collected. To address
these limitations, we have developed a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag antenna array
to allow us to continuously track the movements of small mammals within a one-hectare area
with a 25-meter resolution, without the need for active data collection by a researcher. This PIT
tag antenna array will be used in a pilot study to monitor Ord’s kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii)
before deployment on the Texas kangaroo rat (D. elator). To address concerns on the spatial
resolution of our antenna array, we used the package SiMRiv in program R to simulate the
movement of 1,000 kangaroo rats within a random 1 ha landscape and compared the home
range size of the simulated true data and the data our PIT tag antenna array would have
collected. We conducted a two-tailed t-test on the home range sizes and found that our PIT tag
antenna array did significantly overestimate the size of the home range (0.12 ha) compared to
the true simulated home range size (0.08 ha; p < 2.2e-16). We are currently conducting field
trials with live animals and will report comparisons of real home range estimates of Ord’s
kangaroo rats using this PIT tag antenna array with our estimated home ranges with simulated
data.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
136,Comparative Analysis of Emerging Mayfly Diversity and Abundances and Their Role in Riparian Ecosystem Dynamics within the Upper Llano River Watershed: Implications for Rio Grande Wild Turkey Forage and Riverine Management Strategies,"The Upper Llano River Watershed in Texas, comprising the South and North Llano
Rivers (SLR and NLR) and their tributaries, is ecologically significant, yet faces challenges such
as drought, water withdrawals, invasive species, and declining riparian habitat quality. These
factors threaten the watershed and associated species, with possibly unequal impacts on the
NLR, which experiences intermittent dry periods, unlike the perrenial flows of the SLR. The
increasing frequency and intensity of water loss are particularly concerning for aquatic
invertebrates, including mayflies (Ephemeroptera), whose dynamic seasonal hatches may be
crucial nutrient sources for local species, including Rio Grande Wild Turkeys (RGWT; Meleagris
gallopavo intermedia). This study aims to compare the abundance and species composition of
mayflies between the two rivers as part of a broader investigation into total invertebrate forage
available for the RGWT.  We established two paired 40-meter transects at five sites, three on
the SRL and two on the NLR. One transect was positioned in proximity to the river channel in
the riparian area and the second randomly placed in a nearby riparian-upland corridor. Each
transect included three sticky traps, nine pitfall traps, and a 20-meter sweep net sample
collected every 13-15 days, April – August 2023. Understanding seasonal emergence patterns
of invertebrates across spatial and temporal scales can enhance our knowledge of river
community dynamics. This information can assist with adjusting management strategies that
maximize restoration ecology and will provide insight into the availability of ephemeral,
explosive food sources for Rio Grande Wild Turkeys during critical life stages.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
137,Insect Communities in Relation to Hydroperiod and Local Habitat in the Upper Llano River Watershed,"There is a current lack of data on the foraging habits and diets of Rio Grande Wild
Turkey (RGWT; Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) in the Edwards Plateau Ecoregion (EPE) of
Texas, where RGWT densities and harvest rates are the highest. Invertebrates are crucial for
RGWT nutrition and energetic needs during feather replacement and egg-laying, varying in
abundance across regions. Our goal is to investigate the invertebrate communities in riparian
and upland habitats of the Upper Llano River Watershed and evaluate available forage for
RGWT in context of seasonality and abundance of invertebrates and RGWT, respectively. We
established two 40-meter transects containing three sticky traps and nine pitfall traps at five
sampling sites, three on the South Llano River and two on the North Llano River. One transect
was positioned in proximity to the river channel in the riparian area and the second positioned at
approximately 50-100 meters from the riparian transect in a designated riparian-upland corridor.
At each transect we used a hand-net to collect 20-meter sweep net samples. Samples were
collected every 13-15 days, April – August 2023. We are in the process of compiling data
collected in 2023 to quantify and compare potential invertebrate forage for RGWT, including
identifying samples among all collection techniques and developing a preliminary community
matrix among season, sampling method, and transects. Our community-level data collected
among habitats, season, and methods will provide a background assessment of biodiversity
over time and space to compare to molecular data collected from RGWT fecal samples from a
concurrent study.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
138,Identifying Plant-Pollinator Networks Associated With Grasses in North-Texas,"Long-term studies show declines in global pollinator abundance and floral resources,
necessitating efforts to improve conservation for pollinator-plant relationships at local scales.
Likewise, grassland ecosystems have declined significantly in North America, leading to further
vulnerability of pollinator communities. Although primarily wind-pollinated, grasses provide
nesting structure and supplemental pollen when other floral resources are limited, particularly
during drought. We seek to examine plant-pollinator interactions associated with grasses during
early and late growing seasons to address the following objectives: (1) Quantify pollinator
networks associated with a suite of native, commercially available in working lands during
flowering periods in Texas, and (2) Assess pollen productivity and nutritive value at early and
late flowering stages. We developed a randomized strip plot design at Texas A&M AgriLife
Research and Extension Center in Stephenville, TX including five species of warm-season
grasses: silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroide), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), sideoats
grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and sand dropseed
(Sporobolus cryptandrus). We collected data on soil, pollen, flower visitors, and floral
characteristics. We monitored floral visitor activity through observational counts and vacuum
collections every two weeks during the flowering period in the mornings when temperatures
range between 10 and 33°C. We collected pollen at early and late flowering stages to assay
measuring content on amino acids, proteins, non-structural carbon, nitrogen, proximate and
fiber composition, fatty acids, and micronutrients.  We seek to provide a baseline for
understanding pollinator foraging interactions associated with grass and pollinator health and
guide conservation efforts in Texas grassland ecosystems.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
139,Greater Sandhill Crane Migratory and Population Connectivity as Indicated by Stable Isotopes and Microsatellites,"Greater Sandhill Cranes (Antigone canadensis tabida) in the Intermountain West are
currently managed as three separate populations: Central Valley Population (CVP), Rocky
Mountain Population (RMP), and Lower Colorado River Valley Population (LCRVP). Data from
>120 greater sandhill cranes equipped with platform terminal transmitters from CVP, RMP, and
LCRVP indicate significant overlap among summer, migrating, and wintering locations.
However, these data are limited by the geographic scale, price of transmitters, and other vital
financial and logistical constraints. The goal of this study is to use molecular techniques to
assess population overlap and migratory connectivity among the CVP, RMP, and LCRVP in the
Intermountain West. Our objectives include 1) assess population and genomic overlap and
connectivity using microsatellite markers, 2) assess if stable isotope signatures can be used to
identify locations where populations overlap, and 3) compare molecular data to geospatial data
collected from tagged greater sandhill cranes. We hypothesize 1) significant genetic overlap
exists among the CVP, RMP, and LCRVP in the Intermountain West and 2) population and
genetic connectivity is maintained by flooded agricultural fields and managed wetlands on public
and private lands. We collected the eighth secondary feather to extract microsatellites and
isotopes from twenty-five captured greater sandhill crane colts and 356 adults from the CVP,
RMP, and LCRVP, 2015-2023. Preliminary microsatellite data support our first hypothesis and
we are currently quantifying the magnitude and uncertainty of genetic overlap in addition to
completing objectives two and three.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
140,Assessing Prescribed Burns For Tick Control In Coastal Marsh And Prairie Ecoregion Of Southern Texas,"Tickborne diseases present a growing threat in the United States, impacting both
human and animal health. Methods to mitigate tickborne disease by controlling vectors in the
environment can be logistically challenging and financially unfeasible. Prescribed fire, which is
already utilized in many systems for vegetation management, presents a unique method to both
manage functionality of systems while also reducing vector burdens in the landscape. However,
its utility across different regions in the U.S. is questioned. Here, we assess the impact of
prescribed fire on tick densities in the Coastal Marsh and Prairies ecoregion in southern Texas.
We performed monthly surveillance using the drag method to sample across transects (750 m2)
and around the perimeter of tree mottes, which typically do not burn under prescribed fire
conditions due to insufficient fuel content. All tick species and life-stages (with the exception of
eggs) were collected during surveillance efforts. We demonstrate tick phenology in southern
Texas, with observed seasonal peaks among life stages (nymphs in late winter and spring,
larvae in late spring and summer; adults in fall). Further, we document that prescribed fire is
effective in reducing tick densities in rangelands where grass fuels are continuous. However,
woody mottes may provide environmental refugia for ticks to persist in the landscape, thus,
providing potentially infective ‘islands’ where vectors and reservoirs can converge.
Understanding effects of prescribed fire on tick densities in heterogenous landscapes that burn
unevenly is crucial for addressing specific management challenges posed by tickborne diseases
in the region.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
141,Changes in landscape structure after wildfire in South Texas,"Wildfires are an important natural disturbance and agent of change. Understanding
changes in vegetation communities post-wildfire is important when identifying recovery
pathways. In South Texas, USA, the Borrega Fire burned >21,000 ha in April 2022. Therefore,
our goal was to understand the landscape dynamics pre- and post-wildfire to provide insight into
rangeland recovery pathways. We used daily 3-m resolution satellite imagery and completed
supervised image classifications on one image per month to quantify spatiotemporal changes in
the vegetation distribution. Changes in four land cover classes were assessed: woody, non-
woody, bare ground, and burned (when able to identify charred areas). The March 2022 pre-fire
image consisted of 155 ha prescribed burned, 11,689 ha woody cover, 9,883 ha of non-woody,
and 234 ha bare ground. Immediately after the wildfire, woody cover decreased by 93.6% and
non-woody cover decreased by 69.5%. However, by March 2023, woody cover increased by
2.8% and non-woody decreased by 3.5% compared to pre-wildfire values. Additionally, we
compared Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values of four classes: woody
burned, woody non-burned, non-woody burned, and non-woody non-burned. We determined
the NDVI values of woody burned remained low due to top kill and herbaceous growth within the
understory. It is important to monitor fine-scale temporal changes that occur within vegetation
communities post-wildfire because landscape recovery begins immediately after a wildfire
event. Therefore, understanding recovery pathways is a key factor to implementing appropriate
management methods because results have shown no apparent negative influences on the
rangeland post-wildfire.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
142,Community Structure of Freshwater Turtles Along a Fishing Pressure Gradient,"Understanding the role of natural (e.g., habitat gradients) and anthropogenic (e.g.,
fishing pressure) factors that affect the structure of ecological communities is critical to the
development of conservation strategies. Turtles are amongst the most imperiled group of
organisms in the world which has been attributed to habitat loss, alteration, as well as
exploitation due to fishing pressure (both targeted and incidental). The goal of this project was
to quantify freshwater turtle community structure in the context of ecological (i.e., in-stream
habitat features) and anthropogenic (i.e., passive fishing gear) gradients. From June – October
2023, we surveyed for freshwater turtles at three study sites in east Texas: Alazan Bayou WMA
(unfished), the Attoyac River (fished), and Shawnee (unfished) for a total of 150 trap nights at
each site. We captured fewer turtles at both fished study sites (i.e., Attoyac and Shawnee),
compared to the unfished site (i.e., Alazan). Species composition at the Attoyac differed
significantly from Alazan (p = 0.024) and Shawnee (p = 0.006), however, Alazan and Shawnee
did not significantly differ from one another. We captured a greater number of turtles at locations
with a higher percentage of submerged woody debris and reduced canopy cover. Higher
surface water temperatures reduced turtle captures at the Attoyac and Shawnee study sites,
while increased turtle captures at Alazan. Both the presence of passive fishing gear and the
differences in habitat structure among our study sites appear to be contributing factors for the
dissimilarities in freshwater turtle assemblages.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
143,Investigating the Impacts of Sustainable Grazing Practices on Spiders in North- Central Texas Rangelands,"Arthropods play an important role in maintaining ecosystems integrity through many
services, such as pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control, and serving as prey items for other
species of wildlife. Rangelands, identified as grazing landscapes where native vegetation is
dominant, provide resources for arthropods, including spiders (Arachnida: Araneae), which
exhibit top-down control by regulating herbivorous insect prey populations. However,
overgrazing, pesticide use, and other unsustainable practices may impact the quality of habitat
for spider communities in rangeland ecosystems. The purpose of our study is to determine the
impact of grazing in North-Central Texas rangelands on spiders. Our objectives are 1) Quantify
changes in vegetation communities in rangelands under differing grazing pressures, 2)
Determine the relationship between grazing pressure, spiders, and their arthropod prey in Texas
rangelands, and 3) Identify the best range management practices to promote occupancy and
biodiversity of spider communities. We will establish 4, 0.4-ha fenced plots at Tarleton State
University’s Agriculture Center (Erath County) and Timberlake Biological Research Station (Mills
County) under rotational grazing (1.0 head AUM) with adjacent ungrazed plots for comparison.
We will sample vegetation using 1, 30-m transect via line-intercept method before and after
grazing to measure cover, density, and height for each species. We will sample arthropods
using a series of pitfall traps and vacuum sampling every 5-m and identify arthropods to lowest
taxonomic unit. We hope to guide management practices to improve biodiversity and
sustainability for spiders and other arthropods in Texas rangelands.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
144,Estimating Site-Specific and Region-Wide Density of an Endangered South Texas Felid Using Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture,"Accurate estimation of population size is critical to effectively manage endangered
species. One endangered species for which comprehensive abundance estimation is lacking is
the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), the only neotropical felid with extant populations in the United
States. While ocelots were once native throughout much of the state, habitat loss,
fragmentation, and harvest have restricted their range to two fragmented populations in South
Texas: the “ranch” population at East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch, and the “refuge” population
at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge. To date, no comprehensive multi-site estimate of
abundance nor estimate of region-wide density has been achieved. Our research will 1)
compare the efficacy of spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) density estimation from
camera traps and scat dogs within the “ranch” and “refuge” populations, and 2) determine
relationships between ocelot density and landscape characteristics to extrapolate total density
across the South Texas region. We anticipate the use of scat detection dogs will provide higher
(and likely more accurate) density estimates than cameras but at a higher financial cost. We
also predict that ocelot abundance within South Texas may be higher than previously thought
when extrapolating to a regional scale. These findings will inform progress towards recovery
goals as stated in the Species Recovery Plan and serve as a baseline from which to evaluate
future population dynamics.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
145,Density and Habitat Use if Feral Pigs in Palo Pinto,"Invasive wildlife can have significant ecological impacts on native species and
ecosystems. They can outcompete native species for resources, alter habitats, and cause
population declines in other species. Understanding invasive species is critical to managing a
healthy and functioning ecosystem. Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species that cause
significant ecological and economic damage to native ecosystems in the United States. We aim
to determine feral pig density and habitat use within Palo Pinto Mountains State Park, Strawn,
Texas, a new state park set to open in 2024. We implemented a game camera survey
conducted from September to October 2023, which utilized over 400 trap nights. Our study used
20 randomized camera sites focused on riparian and forested habitat types. Each camera was
positioned 51 cm above the ground, with a minimum distance of 250 meters between them. Our

146,Evaporative water loss and thermal preferences among three sympatric water snakes of the Brazos River drainage,"Climatic factors such as environmental temperatures and aridity are key determinants
of species distributions, and effective thermoregulation and desiccation tolerance are critical to
species-specific physiological performance. Despite its relevance, studies that assess
comparative physiological parameters remain limited for most groups. In the laboratory, we
investigated rates of evaporative water loss (EWL) and thermal preferences in sympatric
natricine snakes of the Brazos River, including the state-threatened Brazos water snake
(Nerodia harteri harteri), endemic to the middle stretches of the river system. Although results
are preliminary, we detected species-specific differences in both EWL and thermal preferences.
After controlling for mass, EWL was highest in the blotched water snake (N. erythrogaster) and
lower in both the diamond-backed water snake (N. rhombifer) and the Brazos water snake,
which were similar in their rates of EWL. In contrast, both blotched water snakes and diamond-
backed water snakes showed similar thermal preferences that were warmer on average than
those measured for Brazos water snakes Brazos water snakes, although individual variation in
measurements was high. Differences in these ecophysiological parameters are expected to
correspond to differences in habitat use and could shed light on present-day abundance and

147,A Range-Wide Hierarchical Abundance Model for Cagle’s Map Turtle,"Cagle’s map turtle (Graptemys caglei) is a small emydid turtle that is endemic to the
Guadalupe River drainage of south-central Texas and is currently listed as state-threatened.
Limited research on the population status of Cagle’s map turtle has been conducted in the
1990s and early 2000s, but with outdated statistical approaches, and current population
assessments are needed. Moreover, hierarchical modeling approaches allow for simultaneous
habitat assessment, providing additional insight into what, until now, has been considered
paradigmatic habitat use for the species (e.g., association with Black Willow [Salix nigra] and
avoidance of impoundments). The goal of our study is to evaluate distribution-wide abundance,
population structure, detection probability, and associated habitat characteristics of Cagle’s map
turtle using N-mixture models. Since June 2021, we performed multiple-pass count surveys of
turtles along 58 unique transects of the Guadalupe, Blanco, and San Marcos Rivers for an
approximate total of 764 river km surveyed. During the count surveys, we also collected
environmental variables as covariates to inform our models. The information gleaned from this

148,Effect of Chinese Tallow on Amphibian Community Ecology and Species Interaction in East Texas Forest Ecosystems,"Amphibian decline is a global phenomenon, with several declines resulting from the
establishment of invasive species. Invasive plants, like Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera), can
alter chemical and physical habitat features, influencing decomposition and nutrient dynamics,
and modifying the trophic structure of invaded ecosystems, which can have detrimental effects
on amphibian populations. Much of the previous research focused on singular species effects,
primarily examining how Chinese tallow leaf litter influences amphibian life history
characteristics such as phenology, development, surfacing behavior, and survival. In essence,
these studies revealed that changes in water chemistry from decomposing Chinese tallow
leaves in aquatic settings effect various aspects of amphibian life history. Nonetheless, there is
a notable scarcity of research investigating the impact of Chinese tallow in east Texas regarding
its impact on amphibians and higher-level ecological occurrences such as community
assemblage and species interactions. To address this gap, mesocosm experiments will
investigate how environmental factors (Chinese tallow leaf fall timing, concentration, and
temperature) impact water chemistry, amphibian growth, survival, and extend to higher-level
ecological phenomena like predator-prey interactions, species competition, and community
formation. Predator and prey arrival times, prey and competitor species size will be manipulated
across various levels of the aforementioned environmental factors. These experiments will
provide insights into amphibian community ecology and species interactions in the presence of
Chinese tallow. Additionally, results from this study will help us understand the potential
ecological impacts of climate-induced shifts in amphibian breeding timing and tree phenology,
using East Texas species as model organisms.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
149,Erosion Control Products and Wildlife Entanglement,"Erosion control products (ECP) are used widely in transportation projects along
construction sites to retain soils during construction. These products are usually netting made
from plastic or natural materials that remain in the environment as vegetation regrowth occurs.
Entanglement of birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals in ECPs have been documented but little
research has been done to quantify the risk of ECPs to wildlife. We will assess how different
ECPs and the various stages of vegetation growth affect wildlife in a controlled experimental
environment. Our hypothesis is that the risk of ECPs will vary as the environment changes from
bare ground to denser vegetation. We will construct a wooden runway to measure wildlife
response to ECPs and simulate vegetation at various levels of growth and density through
placement of road whiskers in combination of ECP types.  We will designate 5 species as
candidates for study and monitor animal behavior as the individual moves across the ECP and
through the whiskers. We will measure behavioral responses to the ECP (e.g., avoidance,
digging below or moving above), and the time it takes to move from one end to another as proxy
for impediment to movement. This study is part of a larger project which aims to increase
understanding the risk of ECPs to wildlife in Texas and improve restoration efforts where
anthropogenic disturbances influence wildlife-habitat relationships.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
150,Informing Recovery: Current Genetic Status of Isolated Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) Populations in South Texas,"Captive breeding and reintroduction programs have saved numerous wildlife species
from extinction but rely on the availability of suitable stocks that are adapted to the local
environment. For the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), reintroduction efforts may be needed for this
species to persist in the northern limit of its current distribution. [RWD1] There are an estimated
< 100 individuals left in the United States in 2 isolated populations. The populations are stable
but threatened by genetic drift, inbreeding, and stochastic events such as hurricanes. Suitable
stocks for reintroduction exist in northern Mexico, but population monitoring efforts in the region
are limited by concerns for human safety. Thus, captive breeding and reintroduction of the
species to expand their range and introduce genetic variation has become an option for their
conservation. To facilitate reintroduction efforts, we will index genetic diversity in captive and
wild populations. Additionally, we aim to assess population divergence between zoo-sourced
and wild ocelots to aid captive breeding pair selection. We are analyzing genetic data collected
from free-ranging ocelots in South Texas during 1991-2023 and zoo-sourced ocelot samples
sourced from 25 zoos (with likely geographic origins of Brazil and North and Central America).
We will use low-coverage whole genome sequencing to assess historical changes in population
size, levels of inbreeding, and population structure.  Preliminary results indicate that the two wild
populations have low genetic diversity with limited gene flow amongst them. These wild
populations may benefit from the introduction of new alleles from captive populations sourced
from diverse geographic locations.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
151,An Assessment of Fine Scale Microclimate Conditions in Purple Martin Artificial Housing and its Influence on Productivity,"Aerial insectivores are experiencing significant long-term population declines
throughout their ranges. The eastern subspecies of Purple Martin (Progne subis subis) is
particularly vulnerable as they are almost entirely dependent on provisioned artificial nesting
cavities. The decline in Purple Martin populations emphasizes the importance of provisioned
housing for the eastern subspecies and is crucial to the long-term conservation of the species.
Our goal is to better understand the influence of microclimate (defined as temperature and
relative humidity conditions inside artificial cavities) on egg and chick survival across the range
of the eastern Purple Martin among six different artificial housing types and 14 study areas
across the eastern United States. Our objectives to reach our goal are: 1) assess microclimate
among six unique house types without the presence of nests or birds and, 2) five–seven
randomly selected artificial houses with active nests at each site, 3) compare internal
microclimate conditions to external, ambient conditions within objectives 1 and 2, 4) conduct
weekly nest status checks per Purple Martin Conservation Association’s Project MartinWatch
Citizen Science protocols. We collected approximately 1.9 million and 2.1 million temperature
and relative humidity readings for objectives 1 and 2, respectively, March-August 2023.
Preliminary analyses are in progress, and we will collect these data again in 2024. Our findings

152,Variation of available browse for white-tailed deer and exotics by ecosite in north- central Texas,"Browse availability for white-tailed deer and exotics in Texas is central to
understanding health, behavior, movement, and other factors crucial to optimum management.
Knowledge of available feedstuffs within specific ecosites can provide a better understanding of
necessary management practices, such as food plot additions and nutrient supplementation to
support healthy populations. On a ranch near Cross Plains, TX, we are determining the quantity
of browsable species within the edge of individual motts, as well as assessing browse diversity
and quantity across ecosites. Additionally, we are working to estimate available browse
produced by each species across seasons. To determine browse availability in 5 pastures,
motts with browsable understory were mapped and circumference (m) of each mott was
measured using ARC GIS. Random points were assigned to mott edges relative to mott
proportions in each pasture. Thirty meter transects were stretched along the edge of motts at
each random point and browsable plants along the transect were identified to species and
tallied. Data were analyzed by ecosite to determine species diversity, density of individuals per
species, and percentage of mott edge each species was estimated to occupy. In fall 2023, the

153,When Nature Calls: Acoustical Measures of Biodiversity and Naturalness in an Urban/Peri-Urban Landscape,"Recently, there has been much interest in using bioacoustics as a indicator of
anthropic influence on urban green spaces to assess biodiversity/species richness within
anthropic landscapes. This is because bioacoustics monitoring may be a very cost effective
means to index the presence or vocal species on a landscape, or to determine the level of
human impactedness of a landscape.  We surveyed 7 urban sites in and around Denton Texas,
a small – midsized city in northeast Texas. At each site we placed a wildlife acoustics micro
acoustic data logger for 5 to 7 days.  Loggers were programmed to record for five minutes of
every hour during that time. We then used the soundecology package from R programming to
analyze the acoustic data to identify high frequency sounds likely to be associated with
anthropic activities, and low frequency sounds typical of natural noise. We also evaluated bird
species richness using Merlin Bird ID app at each site.  Bird species richness varied from 12-16
per site and generally was higher at sites with less higher frequency (technophoinc) noise
spectrum. Preliminary acoustic analysis of one of the sites already shows anthropogenic
influence with higher average acoustic evenness score (AEVE= 0.58) and low average
Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI= -0.089). While not surprising, these results do
support the notion that we can use bioacoustics to evaluate the degree of human impactedness
of urban greenspaces. This may prove to be a valuable tool for conservation and management
of wildlife on anthropic landscapes.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
154,Assessment of Parasitism and Associated Pathogen Prevalence in Free-Ranging Felid Populations in Southern Texas,"Parasites have varying physiological effects on their hosts including reduced nutrient
absorption, decreased blood cell activity, and damage to host tissues. The impact of parasite
burden can be compounded by other internal (e.g., genetic inbreeding) and external (e.g.,
environmental) factors. In southern Texas, two wild felids coexist: ocelots (Leopardus pardalis)
and bobcats (Lynx rufus). Ocelots are endangered in the United States, and the remnant
populations exhibit low levels of genetic diversity, while bobcats are more common across this
region. Our objectives for this ongoing study are to determine parasite and pathogen prevalence
of free-ranging ocelots and bobcats by evaluating endoparasite loads, ectoparasite use, and
pathogen presence.  Fecal flotation for identification of endoparasites was conducted on 48
felids (ocelots, n=17; bobcats, n=31) spanning four years (2019-2022).  The most common
intestinal parasites were Toxascaris leonina (roundworm) and Ancylostoma spp. (hookworm).
Ectoparasites were identified from 69 felids (ocelots, n=26; bobcats, n=43) spanning 35 years
(1985-1986, 2010-2012, 2019-2022).  The most common ectoparasites were ticks
(Dermacentor variabilis) and fleas (Pulex spp).  Pathogen presence in the ectoparasites will be
compared to pathogen presence detected in the host to provide insight surrounding
transmission rates.  Moving forward, ectoparasite and associated pathogen identification will be
completed on additional species (coyote, white-tailed deer, and nilgai) in the study area to
investigate ectoparasite host preference and community pathogen transmission factors.  These
findings provide a better understanding of the felid population’s susceptibility to parasitism and
assist in planning strategies that aid in reducing or preventing transmission of parasites and
infectious disease agents.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
155,"Evaluating the Effects of Grazing Practices on Forage Production, Nutrition, Diversity, and Soil Moisture in the Marfa Grasslands, Texas","Grasslands comprise 20 to 40% of the world’s surface and provide ecosystem
services, such as water retention and purification, directly harvested goods, and carbon
sequestration. However, grasslands are one of the most rapidly declining ecosystems in the
world. Throughout the Anglo-American colonization in Texas during the 1800s, desert
grasslands of the Trans-Pecos were subjected to livestock overgrazing and other improper
agricultural practices. With increasing wildlife conservation values and extensive historic
livestock operations, livestock grazing can enhance wildlife habitat and attain economic
benefits. Rotational and continuous grazing systems modify rangelands and provide income for
ranching operations. This project aims to identify and compare grass species abundance,
annual forage mass production, accompanied soil moisture, and forage nutrition between a
long-term rotational, continuous, and deferred grazing system in a desert grassland of the
Trans-Pecos. Grasses were collected at the end of the 2023 growing season. Random stratified
sampling was used to place 270 0.5 m2 plots in all grazing regimes but confined to two soil
types (Marfa-clay-loam, and Musquiz-clay-loam). Volumetric soil moisture was taken at each
plot with all other floristic data. We expect higher species diversity in the rotational pasture while
more coverage by specific dominant species in the continuous pasture. We expect higher
forage mass production in the rotational system depending on adequate prior precipitation. The
results of this project will allow for grazing to be better used as a management tool to conserve
and restore grasslands.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
156,New and Old Technologies for Soil Erosion Control: Using Remote Sensing to Monitor the Effectiveness of Trincheras,"Soil erosion is a widespread problem that leads to habitat degradation and topsoil
loss. Understanding this process is essential for restoring rangeland communities and targeting
efficient management strategies. With recent advancements in remote sensing technology,
UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are capable of efficiently collecting large amounts of data
while minimizing input and observation costs that help monitor landscape changes over time.
This project aims to monitor the effectiveness of trincheras (i.e., rock filter dams) at retaining
topsoil. We will do this by constructing 3D models of drainage channels using UAV acquired
imagery. We will capture oblique angle images taken from multiple perspectives of the channel
and then use them to construct a 3D model using the SFM (Structure from Motion) technique.
Image sensor, flight altitude, and image overlap can contribute to variability in resolution of the
3D models. We will assess different combinations of flight altitude, image overlap, and camera
sensors to maximize the resolution and assess geomorphic changes over time. After a desired
framework process is developed, we will use the heights from the 3D models to monitor
sediment accumulation from the trincheras. This process can give us a volume of soil
accumulated at trinchera locations and guide management on where to place erosion control
structures to maximize efficiency of topsoil retention.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
157,Wattles for Water: Comparing Five Restoration Treatments for a Severely Degraded Rangeland in the Northern Chihuahuan Desert,"Semiarid ecosystems make up over one-third of the earth's land surface. These
landscapes provide habitat for various flora and fauna and provide important ecosystem
services. However, decades of excessive livestock grazing and extended periods of drought
have transformed many of these systems into brush-dominated landscapes incapable of
performing their historic functions. Such concern drives recovery efforts in the northern
Chihuahuan Desert, where water is the key limiting factor for restoration. Most of the region's
precipitation (>70%) is returned to the atmosphere through transpiration or evaporation. The
remainder leaves the origin site through runoff and overland flow or remains in place through
soil infiltration. Increasing infiltration rates and volume can help increase vegetation germination
in these hot desert shrubland systems. This project aimed to compare five hydrology
improvement treatments placed on a three-hectare test site within a 60-hectare area grubbed
for woody brush in south Brewster County, Texas. All five treatments are based on the
emplacement of biodegradable wattles perpendicular to the land's slope. After one year of
precipitation, results indicate that wattle placement in areas of increased water potential
produced a 35% or greater increase in plant ground cover. Furthermore, decreased soil
temperature along wattles with shade cover produced 25% or more plant production than similar
wattle treatments without shade. This suggests that strategic placement of wattles in areas of
greater water concentration, especially when combined with loose grubbed brush cover
shading, can produce plant ground cover percentages that provide a foundation for restoration
on degraded hot desert sites.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
158,Prevalence and Behavioral Impacts of Toxoplasmosis in Southern Texas White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus),"Toxoplasmosis (causative agent Toxoplasma gondii) is a zoonotic disease that
causes significant morbidity in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Felids are definitive
hosts for T. gondii but most warm-blooded species are susceptible and infection is chronic. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized T. gondii as a leading cause of
death due to foodborne illness in the United States, and classifies toxoplasmosis as a neglected
parasitic infection. Infection has been documented to change host behavior, including loss of
fear, increased aggression, and risk-taking. Human disease has been linked to consumption of
infected wildlife products (e.g., venison), however prevalence data are sparse for free-ranging
game species. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are an ecologically and economically
important species and have been identified as an intermediate host for T. gondii. Therefore,
understanding the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in deer populations has implications for human
health. The objectives of this project are to: 1) assess the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in four
distinct white-tailed deer populations in southern Texas, and 2) investigate the effects of
infection on the behavior of white-tailed deer. This study will leverage ten years of biological
samples and four years of movement data to address stated objectives. Banked serum will be
screened for antibodies using a modified agglutination test and movement data will be used to
identify behavioral discrepancies between infection statuses. Understanding the prevalence of
T. gondii in game species is important for assessing human risk, particularly in southern Texas
where many rural communities reside at the wildland-urban interface.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
159,Examining Population Dynamics and Spatial Ecology of a Declining Population of Pronghorn in the Southern Great Plains,"Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are an ecologically, culturally, and economically
important big game species that historically maintained huntable population levels in Oklahoma.
Recent surveys, however, indicate the population has been declining for more than a decade.
Pronghorn in Oklahoma are limited to the Panhandle region, an area characterized by variable
weather and resource availability, increasing anthropogenic development, and changing
agricultural practices. We developed a comprehensive 5-year research project beginning in
2022, which aims to assess factors influencing population dynamics and to provide
management recommendations to reverse declines. We have captured and GPS collared 147
adult pronghorn, with additional plans to deploy >100 collars over the next two years. We
monitored adult females using movement clustering algorithms and visual observations to
detect parturition events and collared 70 neonates. We monitored collars to assess vital rates
and cause-specific mortality. We collected pronghorn fecal samples to assess the role of diet
quality and parasite loads. We also conducted predator scat surveys to evaluate the relative
occurrence of pronghorn in predator diets and to generate indices of predator abundance. We
will examine the spatial ecology of pronghorn, specifically evaluating resource selection and
interstate movement. This research will be used to develop an integrated population model to
estimate population growth rates and will inform for population monitoring, habitat management,
and harvest strategies for pronghorn in the southern Great Plains.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
160,A Comparison of Survey Methods for the Calculation of the Bird Friendliness Index,"To address the decline of grassland birds in the Great Plains region of the United
States, the Audubon Society has established the Conservation Ranching Incentive (CRI) for
landowners to promote land management practices that benefit native grassland communities.
One tool to assess the efficacy of this program is the Bird Friendliness Index (BFI), which
considers bird densities, conservation status, and ecosystem function to provide a numerical
score to determine a property’s capacity to sustain diverse and resilient grassland bird
populations. This research aims to compare BFI scores between CRI enrolled and non-enrolled
properties, to compare methods of collecting bird count data for BFI calculation, and to
determine whether amendments are needed in BFI methodology to better suit the Arid
Southwest region. During the spring of 2023, six properties with varying grazing practices, land
use, and CRI membership status were surveyed. A total of 228 individual point counts in 9 16-
point plots yielded 3,348 total observations of 57 species. Although not a complete reflection of
grassland health and function, initial analyses of α biodiversity metrics suggest that CRI
enrollment status was not a predictor of richness or Shannon’s diversity within these sites, with
an intensely grazed, non-enrolled site possessing higher values (S = 32, H = 2.9) than all but
one CRI enrolled site. While statistical significance cannot yet be determined due to small
sample size and high inter-site variability, future monitoring and analysis will allow for a
thorough comparison of BFI scores between sites and efficiency of different count
methodologies.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
161,Guiding Wildlife: Evaluating Wildlife Exit Designs and Sensor Lights for Safer Highways in South Texas,"Globally, road networks have been expanding rapidly and are expected to increase
further in the coming years. Roads benefit humans when moving to and from distant places,
saving time and money. However, the same linear infrastructure can act as a physical barrier to
wildlife movement and result in habitat fragmentation. To alleviate the effects of roads on wildlife
in south Texas, wildlife underpasses, wildlife guards (WG), and exclusionary fencing were
deployed by TxDOT to prevent wildlife road mortalities. However, fences can sometimes act as
a barrier for wildlife stranded within the Right-of-Way (ROW). To address this, TxDOT installed
ten wildlife exits (WEs), to allow wildlife to escape the ROW, and sensor triggered lights (STLs)
on 13 WGs, to prevent animals from crossing the WG at night. The objectives of this research
were to compare the wildlife use of a modified WE design with previous designs and to assess
the effectiveness of STLs in deterring wildlife from using WGs. Reconyx trail cameras were
used to monitor each WE and WG for a year. Images were downloaded every two weeks, then
sorted by species and interaction. A comparison of successful wildlife use of WE between the
designs will be made using ANOVA. The number of refusals by wildlife to enter the road at WG
before and after installing the STLs at WGs will also be analyzed with ANOVA. If successful,
these novel and cost-effective designs can be replicated on highways with fences worldwide,
reducing the rate of wildlife-vehicle collisions.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
162,Avian Community Response to Removal of Encroaching Woody Vegetation in Trans- Pecos Grasslands,"The grasslands of North America are one of the fastest declining habitat types on the
continent. This is due to a variety of reasons, including energy conversion, livestock grazing,
and woody plant encroachment. As a result of this habitat loss, grassland-obligate bird species
are in steep decline across the continent. An estimated 88% of migratory grassland birds
overwinter in the Chihuahuan Desert. Woody plant encroachment within the Chihuahuan Desert
has decreased available grasses, leading to a reduction in winter food availability and nocturnal
thermal cover. Encroached woody vegetation also provides more habitat and perching
opportunities for avian predator species, such as loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) and
American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Grassland restoration efforts typically involve brush
removal using herbicide, mechanical removal, and fire. In the Trans-Pecos, we will study sites
within the Marathon and Marfa grasslands where herbicide and mechanical removal have been
used on mesquite varieties (Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var. glandulosa and Prosopis glandulosa
Torr. var. torreyana), creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), and tarbush (Flourensia venus). We will
be conducting non-breeding bird surveys and vegetation surveys across a control site, a site 4
years post herbicide treatment, and a site that used mechanical removal 4 years after having
been treated with herbicide. Our results will help inform broad-scale restoration that will
hopefully result in increases for species currently listed as Species of Greatest Conservation
Need.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
163,Restoration of Native Vegetation in Areas Invaded by Lehmann´s Love Grass,"Native and non-native grassland species interact and compete for space and
resources. Sometimes, those negative interactions can affect native species by leading them to
eradication and converting a rangeland into monocultures. This is due to non-native species
having aggressive behavior and better response than natives towards drought and wildfires.
Also, some non-native plant species are not preferred by wildlife. For example, scaled quail
(Callipepla squamata) habitat is indirectly affected by negative interactions with invasive species
such as Lehmann Lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana). Therefore, we initiated a restoration
project to mitigate Lehmann Lovegrass monocultures and increase native plants for scaled
quail. This project was located in Southern Brewster County and is part of the Chihuahua
Desert. Our goal is to evaluate ways to decrease and control Lehmann Lovegrass. Therefore,
we established 200 plots, 16 m2 each, with 4 treatments. Treatments are soil disturbance,
native plant seeding, soil disturbance and seeding, and a Control. We used 3 line intersections
in each plot. We implemented treatments during the summer of 2022, Data was taken in the
post-rainy season in October 2022, the winter season in February 2023, and is going to be
measured by two years. Data already collected was treated with a RDA to find relationships
between treatments and species,  preliminary results indicate that in bouth seasons, LLG is still
present, but seeding, and soil disturbance and seeding treatments have more relation with
natives plant species and LLG is more related with controls. While soil disturbance treatment
have a negative relation with LLG.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
164,Livestock Tanks for Migratory and Wintering Grassland Birds in the Trans-Pecos,"Many grassland bird species are undergoing steep population declines, including
many birds that winter in the Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. Overwintering birds in this region
have declined by 70%. However, there is little data on habitat preferences and resource
utilization for many grassland bird species during migration and winter. In the arid landscape of
the Chihuahuan Desert, livestock tanks may be an important water source for birds, and
potentially an important food source as well for birds that feed on invertebrates in moist soils.
Our study will document which migrating and wintering birds utilize livestock tanks, and what
characteristics of livestock tanks relate to bird diversity and abundance. We are using
automated recording units (ARUs) and point-count surveys at dirt livestock tanks to determine
bird species presence, abundance, and behavior. Characteristics sampled at each tank include
soil invertebrates and environmental characteristics such as shrub density and soil moisture.
Early surveys have documented 35 species of birds actively using the tanks and engaging in a
variety of behaviors. The variety of birds utilizing the tanks has included raptors, shorebirds,
warblers, sparrows, flycatchers, and ducks. Tanks with and without water can both provide
appealing habitat to birds, as moist soils within dry tanks lead to plant growth that differs from
the surrounding grassland and to soil invertebrate foraging opportunities. Knowing more about
how birds use livestock tanks as a resource can help inform management decisions to conserve
imperiled bird populations, especially on private rangelands.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
165,"Movement Ecology, Dispersal, and Genetic Relatedness of Mountain Lions (Puma concolor), in South Texas and Mexico","Barriers to movement have complex and widespread influences on population
dynamics. Anthropogenic barriers like fencing can impede wildlife movements and fragment
populations, thereby, eroding genetic diversity, lowering species fitness measures, and
increasing a population's extirpation risk. To date, there has been little empirical research to
examine if and how the border barrier system separating the United States and Mexico affects
the movement ecology, genetic connectivity, and population viability of large mammals. Our
project helps fill this research gap by using movement ecology and population genetics to
elucidate barrier-induced ecological and demographic consequences on mountain lions (Puma
concolor), an apex carnivore able to disperse long distances, and generally requiring large,
unfragmented areas of habitat. Our research will investigate mountain lion space use at fine and
broad scales, determining the relative importance of maintaining robust Mexican mountain lion
populations and transboundary movements of Mexican mountain lions into Texas, for genetic
exchange and persistence of viable mountain lion populations in south Texas. Specifically, we
will (1) use movement data from GPS collars to evaluate landscape permeability for mountain
lions, and (2) use DNA samples from captured mountain lions and historical samples from
individuals in Texas and Mexico to describe the genetic relatedness and structure of mountain
lions in the borderland region through time. Evaluation of dispersal corridors and genetic
structure in the context of the border barrier system will assess the sustainability of mountain
lion populations in south Texas, while informing possible statewide and bi-national management
and mitigation needs of this transboundary carnivore.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
166,Concrete Jungles and Carnivorous Residents: A Multifaceted Exploration of Mesocarnivore Dynamics in Urban Greenspaces,"Habitat fragmentation is a challenge for most wildlife, but specifically for medium to
large mammals as they are more vulnerable to alterations in physical and biological traits as a
result of habitat loss and isolation. As landscape connectivity is essential for urban carnivores
for movement and dispersal behavior, it is expected that with decreasing connectivity, less
functional linkages and higher human presence, carnivores’ persistence and survivability will
waver within urban matrices. Denton, TX is a model study site for landscape composition as it
has both isolated and natural habitat patches with diverse urban wildlife. The goal of my study is
to assess the role of landscape connectivity to maintain a functional metapopulation dynamic of
mammal diversity in urban greenspaces. This study used primarily camera-trapping using
SECR analysis for bobcat (Lynx rufus) and coyote (Canis latrans)density with covariate data of
small-mammal trapping for abundance, camera-traps for mesocarnivore occupancy, and
vegetation indices for tree diversity and habitat naturalness. Preliminary results demonstrate
high density of bobcats within isolated patches while coyotes’ density is higher in greenspace
corridors. Additionally, small-mammal trapping may suggest low prey density of white-footed
mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) within natural patches.
Over the next year, remaining field data will be analyzed for least cost paths, potential corridors,
and habitat patch comparison to aid in urban wildlife ecology and conservation for the City of
Denton.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
167,Demographic Analyses Suggests Lewisville Population of Painted Buntings is a Demographic Sink,"The Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris) is considered a “species of conservation
concern” by the US Fish and Wildlife Service due to persistent population declines, and the
Breeding Bird Survey notes that the species has declined 56% in Texas from 1966-2022. We
collected demographic data from a seven year mark-recapture study on painted buntings in
Lewisville, TX (2017-2023). We used a Matrix Projection Model to model population dynamics
and then conducted retrospective and prospective analysis on the demographic data to
determine the influence of the different vital rates on the finite rate of population change.
Juvenile survival (SJA=0.09), adult survival (SA=0.41), and fecundity (FA=0.51) were low. The
population was projected to decline (λ=0.502), however, count data over the seven year period
has shown the population steadily increasing, which suggests that the painted bunting
population in Lewisville may be an ecological sink supported primarily by immigration. The
results of the retrospective analysis indicated that the finite rate of population change was most
sensitive to adult and juvenile survivorship, while the results of the prospective analysis
indicated that management focused on adult survival would have the greatest benefits on
mitigating population declines.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
168,Evaluating Wildlife Diversity Responses to Pine Plantation Age Structure Using a Multi-taxa Survey,"The Southern U.S. accounts for over half of the timber production in the country,
generating over 54 billion dollars of income annually. Forest plantations in the Southeastern
U.S. are predominantly composed of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). As pine trees are continually
being planted and harvested, this cycle creates a mosaic of stands made up of different cohorts.
This mosaic provides a diversity of habitats and therefore contributes to a dynamic
recolonization of wildlife species. Our research will use a multi-taxa approach to sample insect
floral visitors, herpetofauna, avifauna, and mammalian fauna within loblolly pine plantations to
determine differences in wildlife assemblages among stand ages (cohorts). We will utilize the
following equipment for our sampling techniques: blue vane traps, coverboards, automated
recording units (ARUs), and camera traps. These items will be used across 12 sites containing
young (2-6 years old) and mature (18-22 years old) pine stands, i.e., a paired-plot sampling
design. We expect young pine stands to have greater species richness levels for insect floral
visitors and reptiles, while mature pine stands will have greater species richness levels for birds,
mammals, and amphibians. Results from our study will improve our understanding of the
influence and dynamics of pine forest age structure on wildlife species in Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
169,Space Use of Sympatric Aoudad and Mule Deer in the Trans-Pecos,"The ecology of Aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) in Texas is poorly understood, where the
introduced African species coexist and potentially interact with the native mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus). Aoudad space-use, daily activity cycles, and social dynamics are largely unknown in
the Trans-Pecos region of Texas. However, they are important relative to their potential impact
on mule deer and desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) recovery in the region. With
improved quantitative techniques in movement ecology, aoudad space-use can be readily
assessed using the Brownian bridges movement model, calculated using collar data. No
literature has quantified aoudad utilization distributions using the BBMM or examined the
influence of aerial gunning relative to changes in movement behavior. In April 2023, 40 aoudad
and 40 mule deer were captured and collared in the Chinati and Quitman Mountain ranges.
Collars record the animal’s location via satellite at 2-hour fixes. To date, utilization distributions
for both aoudad and mule deer have been calculated for each collared individual. Results
demonstrate aoudad on average range over wider areas (58.04 km2 in the Quitmans and 23.99
km2 in the Chinatis) compared to mule deer average space-use (3.30 km2 in the Quitmans and
3.87 km2 in the Chinatis). Utilization distribution overlap between species was calculated using
the Bhattacharyya’s Affinity (BA) niche overlap metric, resulting in a 58.5% overlap in the
Quitmans and 40.6% in the Chinatis. Comparing pre- and post-aerial gunning movement
behavior will prove valuable in understanding aoudad movement spatially and temporally, for
future development in native big game recovery.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
170,Species-Specific Patterns of Consumption of Oral Rabies Vaccine Baits in the South Texas Plains,"Oral Rabies Vaccine (ORV) baits have been aerially dropped along the US-Mexico
border since 1995 for canine rabies. However, there is little information on the fate of baits once
they are deployed across the landscape. Our goal is to determine which species are consuming
the ORV baits in the South Texas Plains. We used ArcGIS to generate eight 1 km2 grids with 18
camera trap sites in each grid. We hand applied one ORV bait per camera trap at two grids
during each application trip. We collected camera data from 144 different sites for four
consecutive weeks during each of the four calendar seasons on the East Foundation’s San
Antonio Viejo Ranch. We will determine species-specific consumption of ORV baits, and how
other factors, such as season may affect consumption patterns. We will generate competing a
set of competing models and use Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to determine which model
best explains specific-specific patterns of bait use among those considered. We will evaluate
how temperature, season, and species impacts ORV bait consumption. We will then check the
likelihood of our top models. We predict that species and season will affect ORV bait
consumption. The results from this study will help better inform ORV management practices for
future ORV aerial drops.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts
171,"Movement Patterns, Home Range, and Microhabitat Use of Alligator Snapping Turtles in a Small East Texas Stream","The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii), the largest freshwater turtle in
North America, faces numerous threats, with population declines and range contractions
suspected to have occurred across the historic range of the species. Most studies on movement
patterns and microhabitat use of M. temminckii have been conducted in large, open, lentic
environments and few studies have been conducted in small, lotic habitats. We investigated the
movement and microhabitat use of adult female and juvenile M. temminckii within Bonaldo
Creek, a small tributary of the Angelina River in eastern Texas. Six M. temminckii were
monitored (2-3 relocations per week) via radiotelemetry from July 2008 to September 2009. We
found that the linear home range for adult females (1395.5 – 405.1 m) was higher than that of
the unsexed juveniles (996.9 – 439.7 m), although movement frequency was similar between
groups. Juveniles utilized a smaller subset of microhabitats compared to adult females. Adult
females utilized microhabitats with abundant submerged structure, while overhanging
vegetation was an important microhabitat feature for juveniles. The broader microhabitat use we
observed in adult females may have been influenced by seasonal factors, highlighting the need
for more long-term, seasonal assessments of M. temminckii movement and microhabitat. Such
investigations will bolster our understanding of the spatial and temporal factors that influence M.
temminckii populations in different systems.",poster,Professional Poster Session
172,Activity patterns of a reintroduced population of Louisiana Pinesnakes across multiple temporal scales,"Knowledge of an organism’s phenology can inform monitoring efforts by maximizing
detections during surveys, especially when time and effort is limited. Conservation efforts for the
Louisiana Pinesnake (Pituophis ruthveni), a federally threatened species, include a
reintroduction program with the release of captive reared snakes. Since 2010, snakes (N = 408)

of Louisiana. Individuals were marked with a PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tag prior to
their release on the reintroduction site where they were monitored with automated PIT tag
readers (APTRs) and box traps. Through this large scale and intensive monitoring effort, we
sought to quantify the daily and monthly activity patterns of Louisiana pinesnakes. Snake
activity was highest in May, and decreased, but remained consistent, during the summer
months (June – September). APTRs revealed the daily activity patterns of snakes with the
greatest activity occurring between from 1100 – 1800 h with a peak of activity between 1200 –
1300 h. These data will assist decision makers in determining when to monitor for these snakes
if/when resources are limited. These results can also be used to help guide a standardized

173,King Ranch Bluestem Expansion on Small Prairies in Southeastern Texas from 2012 to 2023,"Many small and isolated prairies occur on the Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF)
in southeastern Texas as disjunct extensions of the southern portion of the larger blackland
prairie ecoregion to the west. King Ranch (KR) bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum), an invasive
grass native to Eurasia and North Africa, has been planted in Texas by ranchers as forage and
by the highway department along roadsides. From there it has been unintentionally spread to
other areas. KR bluestem is now well established on many SHNF prairies where it aggressively
competes for space with native prairie vegetation, drastically altering the plant composition at
some sites by creating dense, homogeneous stands over time. In 2012, we measured the total
area of six prairies (mean = 2.1 ha) and the total area within each prairie dominated (≥50%) by
KR bluestem. In 2023, we again measured the area dominated by KR bluestem within the same
prairies. We compared 2012 and 2023 measurements to determine the extent of KR bluestem
expansion during the eleven-year interim. The mean percent area dominated by KR bluestem in
2012 and 2023 was 7.8% and 19.7%, respectively. This translates to a 150% increase in area
dominated by KR bluestem from 2012 to 2023 on the six prairies. The transition from a native
prairie plant assemblage to dense expanses of KR bluestem may negatively affect certain
vertebrate communities. There is evidence suggesting that rodents and some species of
overwintering sparrows in these prairies tend to avoid larger areas of dense KR bluestem.",poster,Professional Poster Session
174,Piping Plover Winter Site Fidelity Along the Upper Texas Coast,"The Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) is federally listed as threatened in the United

individuals we observed during long-term winter surveys. To evaluate site fidelity, we chose four
flagged Piping Plover at random from all flagged plovers (N = 63) seen at least once at
Matagorda Peninsula along the Upper Texas Coast from fall 2018 through spring 2023. We
determined distance between known breeding (capture) location and first observed winter
detection at the site. After initial observation, each flagged plover was observed multiple times
throughout the non-breeding season along the peninsula. We determined the ages of the
observed Piping Plover ranged from 5 to 12 years and average distance traveled during annual
migration was 3,167 kilometers. By looking at the origin of each Piping Plover, we noted that all
four individuals originated from the Great Plains Region (North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado,
and Nebraska) and are from threatened populations. With each individual seen yearly for four
consecutive seasons within the same location, continued monitoring and conservation efforts
are necessary to maintain this important wintering habitat for this, and other, imperiled species.",poster,Professional Poster Session
175,"Effects of Range Management on the Plateau Spot-tailed Earless Lizard, Year 2 Results","The plateau spot-tailed earless lizard (Holbrookia lacerata) is currently under review
for federal listing. Its range includes the semi-desert grasslands of the Edwards Plateau in
Central Texas, across which apparent population declines have been observed. On a
microhabitat scale, previous research has shown that H. lacerata is most often encountered on
bare ground and less frequently in dense or brushy vegetation. Our research objective is to
better understand which rangeland management practices cultivate microhabitat landscapes
preferred by H. lacerata. Our second year of surveys have concluded at the Texas A&M AgriLife
Research Station at Sonora in Edwards County. The Sonora Station has researched long-term
control, grazing, and fire management treatments for decades, providing a well-documented
landscape that focuses on rangeland practices already implemented in this region. A diverse
habitat mosaic may be preferable to our target species and rangeland practices such these are
regularly used to control patches of woody vegetation and encourage such landscapes. For H.
lacerata detection surveys we use a stratified random sampling design with forty 0.8-ha circular
survey plots across four treatments: control, graze, burn, and burn and graze. In year two we
also began vegetation surveys with a sampling design derived from the point-centered quarter
method, as well as H. lacerata tracking. Preliminary results show that individuals were found
primarily in grazed (n=10), burned (n=7), or burned and grazed plots (n=5), with only one
individual caught in the control plots. We will continue to survey H. lacerata and collect habitat
data in 2024.",poster,Professional Poster Session
176,Camera-Trap Basking Arrays Detect Western Chicken Turtles in Dynamic Ephemeral Wetland Mosaics,"Temperature and precipitation vary regionally, seasonally, and annually creating
different constellations of ephemeral wetlands over time. Species occupying ephemeral
wetlands must track these dynamics as the location, size, shape, permanence, density, and
spatial conﬁguration of suitable habitat shifts. Such species can be difficult to sample, especially
when methods involve intensive trapping. Semiaquatic freshwater turtles, in particular, can be
difficult to study with traditional trapping techniques, because individuals track shifting suitable
habitat via far-ranging terrestrial movements throughout large, dynamic ephemeral wetland
complexes. Here, we develop and assess the efficacy of an inexpensive camera-trap basking
array designed to move up and down with the changing water levels of ephemeral wetlands
occupied by Western Chicken Turtles, a subspecies under review for listing under the U.S.
Endangered Species Act. At a study site in Texas, we deployed one camera-trap basking array
at four different wetlands, all known to have chicken turtles present. The camera-trap basking
array was effective at detecting Western Chicken Turtles at three of the four wetlands during the
study. On-going research is focusing on understanding the causes of this variation in detection
across all four wetlands. The simple, durable design and low cost (<$500, US) of this camera-
trap basking array provides opportunities to scale up surveys for the species range-wide and to
conduct research on its behavior and population dynamics within ephemeral wetland
complexes.",poster,Professional Poster Session
177,A Collaborative Approach to Managing and Recovering Wild Houston Toad Populations,"Houston Toads (Anaxyrus houstonensis) have been federally listed as endangered
under the Endangered Species Act since 1970 due to a multitude of factors contributing to the
loss and alteration of this species’ native habitat. Currently, there is a multipronged collaborative
effort involving federal, state, and local agencies working on a Houston Toad management and
recovery program. The prongs of this program include protecting and restoring habitat,
propagating and supplementing individuals into the wild, establishing a monitoring program, and
educating the public through outreach programs. As a part of this recovery program, the Natural
Resources Institute has been tasked with monitoring and surveying for wild chorusing Houston
Toad populations in Robertson and Leon Counties, TX. To detect chorusing Houston Toads, we
established 20 roadside auditory survey points in each county based on historical records and
results from habitat models. To supplement the driving surveys, we also deployed 20 automatic
recording devices (ARDs) on private lands throughout these counties. In total, we conducted
33.4 hours of roadside auditory surveys and the ARDs collected approximately 3247.1 hours of
recordings between 6 January 2023 and 14 July 2023. The surveys were unsuccessful in
detecting wild chorusing Houston Toads, but we did detect the presence of 12 anuran species
calling during this survey period. Here, we present our preliminary results and future work
towards managing and recovering wild Houston Toad populations in Robertson and Leon
Counties, TX.",poster,Professional Poster Session
178,Using Automated Recording Units to Examine the Calling Behavior of the American Woodcock in Eastern Texas,"The American woodcock (Scolopax minor) is found in forested habitats across
eastern North America, with eastern Texas representing the southwestern most part of their
breeding range. The woodcock has a unique breeding display which starts with “peent” calls
and continues with a spiraling flight that can extend upwards to 350 feet off the ground. We
implemented a sampling protocol to determine if automated recording units (ARUs) were
suitable for detecting American woodcock, and if so, examine the calling behavior of the
American woodcock in eastern Texas, specifically on the Sam Houston National Forest. We
detected American woodcock at 19 of the 20 sites we sampled from 20 January through 5
March 2023. Detections included four sound types: “peent” call, display flight, “cackle” call and
fly overs. Peent calls and display flights, which represent breeding behavior, were detected at
16 of 20 sites sampled. Woodcocks called as early as one minute after sunset but, on average,
calling began 15 minutes after sunset and these vocalizations continued for an average of 20
minutes per night. Although our ARUs were not deployed in time to determine the date of first
calling in 2023, the last vocalization of the season was detected on 5 March 2023. In our study,
American woodcock were detected at nearly all our survey sites suggesting that the species
was common and widespread across the Sam Houston National Forest in 2023. We conclude
that ARUs are very effective at detecting calling and flight displays associated with American
woodcock breeding activity.",poster,Professional Poster Session
179,Marine Debris and Public Outreach: a Dashboard is Worth a Thousand Words,"Though marine debris is a known danger to coastal ecosystems and wildlife,
resolving the litter problem requires changing the attitude of the public and inspiring care for the
environment.SPLASh (Stopping Plastic Pollution Along Shorelines- a litter cleanup group based
in the Houston-Galveston region) connects people to wildlife via programming that specifically
targets litter in bird habitats. SPLASh runs litter cleanups with the support of volunteers,
collecting and documenting litter using a specific methodology (STOP), creating reliable and
consistent data. This data is then added to the Texas Litter Database, a statewide repository of
publicly available litter data. SPLASh requested an online visual representation of their project
progress, using metrics from their litter cleanups.  While presenting scientific data in a friendly,
engaging manner can be challenging, the use of maps, landmarks and attention-grabbing
graphics can help citizens recognize issues impacting their communities. Dashboards can be a
major asset to the web presence of an organization, especially if metrics are important for any
funding or outreach efforts. To create a solution for SPLASh, we imported cleanup data to
design a versatile and flexible solution that combined ArcGIS Storymaps and Dashboards for
their project.  These dashboards seamlessly import data directly from database downloads
allowing the system to be easily used by non-GIS professionals, allowing SPLASh to maintain
the system independently with little to no assistance.",poster,Professional Poster Session
180,How Do Ethnicity and Gender Affect Students Choosing Careers in Wildlife?,"Ethnic and gender diversity are commonly sought after by universities and employers
alike.  While we agree this is a worthy goal, we questioned whether factors outside the control of
universities and employing organizations influenced students’ selection of careers, which
resulted in skewed diversity within the field of wildlife science.  We compared ethnic and gender
composition of the general population (US, Texas, and southern Texas) from the US Census
Bureau to declared majors at a Hispanic-serving institution in southern Texas (Texas A&M
University-Kingsville; TAMUK) in 2010, 2015, and 2021.  We found that the percent of Hispanics
enrolled in a Rangeland and Wildlife Sciences Department (RWSC) was substantially less
(51.7%) than the Hispanic population at TAMUK (68.5%), and female Hispanics comprised only
16% (N=26) of RWSC students.  Only <1% and 0% of African Americans and Asians,
respectively, were enrolled in RWSC at TAMUK.  We conducted an informal survey of TAMUK
students (N = 146) to better understand what factors influenced their career choice.  The
majority of Hispanic females (79%; 34 of 43) stated they were taught as children that women
became teachers or nurses.  Asian students (N = 5) said they received parental influence to
enter careers similar to their parents, either in medicine, engineering, or finance.  Only
Caucasian students (N = 24) believed their career choice was their own to decide.  If
universities and institutions desire diversity, programs designed to increase diversity in the
workforce must start early and include outreach to parents.",poster,Professional Poster Session
181,A GEM in the Rough? The Grasslands Effectiveness Monitoring (GEM) Protocol as An Integrated and Tiered Approach to Grassland Habitat Treatment Assessment,"There have been successful voluntary conservation programs, such as the Grassland
Restoration Incentive Program (GRIP) and the USFWS Partners, that assist private landowners
with restoring critically declining grassland habitat in Texas (98% privately owned). The success
of these restoration and conservation programs are insightful and have slowed grassland
habitat degradation and loss. However, few monitoring protocols exist that scientifically evaluate
the extent to which habitat is successfully restored and if best management practices were
used. Therefore, members of the USFWS, USGS, Oaks and Prairies Joint Venture, Texas
Parks and Wildlife, and Rio Grande Joint Venture developed the Grassland Effectiveness
Monitoring (GEM) protocols which are modified from the Bureau of Land Management
Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) strategy, and are compatible with data collected
by the Natural Resources Conservation Service National Resource Inventory rangeland on-site
survey. Thus, GEM is a statistically robust, user-friendly option to assess the effectiveness of
best management practices used in restoring grassland habitat. After two years of pilot field
work, GEM is proving to be scientifically sound in its ability to detect changes in vegetation
structure post-management. GEM allows users to choose between three different tiered
approaches, with each protocol having varying levels of complexity, catering to expertise level,
monitoring goals, budget, and project timelines. Therefore, by creating a standardized protocol
that can be widely used in grassland restoration across North America, we may be better
prepared to understand how management practices are influencing restoration efforts.",poster,Professional Poster Session
182,Movement and Habitat Selection of Repatriated and Wild Alligator Snapping Turtles in Eastern Texas,"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is the largest freshwater turtle
in North America. Although M. temminckii occur in a variety of riverine habitats, they possess a
life history characterized by high juvenile mortality and longer maturation periods. Therefore,
illegal harvest or bycatch may exacerbate local population declines. Knowledge of their spatial
ecology in the wild is limited, and few translocation studies are known. Here, we investigated the
movement and habitat use (i.e., macro- and microhabitat selection) of repatriated and wild M.
temminckii to explore the feasibility of repatriation efforts. Repatriated and wild turtles, fitted with
VHF radios, were monitored weekly from September 2022 to September 2023. We calculated
home ranges using 95% Auto-correlated Kernel Density Estimates (AKDE), and investigated
movement over time with Generalized Additive Models (GAM). Incorporating a hierarchal
approach, we quantified macrohabitat availability and collected a suite of microhabitat variables
at M. temminckii locations and paired random points. We observed sex-specific differences in
home range size in both groups, and found repatriated female home ranges less contiguous
compared to wild females. Seasonal movement responses were similar between groups, but
repatriated turtle movements were exacerbated compared to wild turtles. We found repatriated
turtles utilized more riverine macrohabitat and wild turtles utilized mostly wetlands and oxbows.
However, we found no difference in microhabitat selection between groups. Our results suggest
key aspects of M. temminckii ecology can be affected when introduced into novel environments,
and this may impact the long-term ability to acquire resources over time and survive.",poster,Professional Poster Session
