1,Distribution and Occupancy of The Alligator Snapping Turtle in Texas,"Texas contains the southwestern range edge of the alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii). Surveys in other states at the range edge of the species, indicate overall range contraction, providing an impetus to fully understand the distribution of the species in Texas. It is protected as a threatened species in the state, but due to harvest activities, populations have declined, and it has now been proposed for federal listing as a threatened species. We sought to determine habitat covariates that affect its detectability (p) and occupancy (Ψ), as this information allows estimation of the importance of habitat characteristics to its presence. We conducted hoop trap surveys at 50 sites throughout eastern Texas, allocating 3 consecutive surveys per site to allow estimation of p and Ψ using occupancy models. These surveys confirmed the presence of M. temminckii at 61% of sites, and showed that its distribution extends farther than previously known (9 new county records). Across Texas, captured turtles exhibited an even sex ratio (P = 0.586), and we captured significantly fewer turtles from sites where trotlines were observed (P = 0.015). We developed models with predictors of p and Ψ and ranked them using AICc. The highest ranked model for p included flow velocity, trap density, air temperature, and lunar cycle, while increased forest cover was the strongest predictor of Ψ. The global model was well fit to the data (P = 0.376), providing evidence that relatively undeveloped watersheds with high forest cover are important for the species’ occurrence and conservation.",oral,Cottam Awards,2022,NA
2,Movements and Resource Selection of Wild Pigs in Relation to Crop Growth Stage,"One of the most successful invasive species is frequently implicated in wildlife-agriculture conflicts: the wild pig (Sus scrofa). Pig damage is a major source of crop loss and is expected to increase as pig populations expand, threatening the food supply and increasing economic costs of food production. An analysis of wild pig movement behaviors and seasonal resource selection would enable producers and landowners to determine how best to alleviate pig damage in an agricultural landscape. The objectives were to determine the movement responses, space use, and selection within home ranges (i.e., third order) relative to resource availability and landscape features that drive wild pig behaviors. We monitored hourly movements of adult wild pigs relative to corn crops using GPS collars during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons (Feb-Sept) in Delta County, Texas, USA. We conducted separate analyses during 5 primary growth stages of corn: pre-planting, establishment, vegetative, blister-milk, and dent-mature. We calculated movement metrics, dynamic Brownian Bridge movement model home range estimates, and step selection functions, by sex and stage. Overall, males had larger movements and space use than females. Most pigs showed resident movement behaviors. Space use of wild pigs and selection for corn increased with the progression of corn growth stages. Pigs consistently select for sheltered areas and landscape context influenced use of corn. This study provides information of wild pig spatial ecology and timing of corn use that should aid producers in deciding the best timing and combination of damage mitigation methods for their situation.",oral,Cottam Awards,2022,NA
3,Predictors of Occupancy of a Declining Songbird (Bachman's Sparrow) At the Western Extent of Its Range,"The Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) is a savanna specialist that relies on fire-maintained, open woodlands or old fields with a dense, herbaceous understory. Across its range, fire suppression and habitat loss have caused population declines, yet most research has focused on populations east of the Mississippi River. In Texas, this species is at the westernmost fringe of its range where vulnerability to extirpation is heightened. Our research paired detection data with habitat measurements to build statistical models that predict Bachman’s Sparrow site occupancy. We placed autonomous recording units (Wildlife Acoustic SM4s and Minis) to detect sparrows at sites of potential occupancy based on a species distribution model and measured local vegetation characteristics and one regional covariate at each plot. We paired measurements with presence/absence using the R package “unmarked” to build hierarchical occupancy models ranked by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). We detected Bachman’s Sparrow at 40 of 240 sites (naïve occupancy estimate = 0.17). The top detection model had one covariate, midstory density, while the top occupancy model included herbaceous ground cover, midstory density, basal area, and canopy height and distance to source population. These results suggests that management for Bachman’s Sparrow should focus on practices that minimize midstory and reduce basal area in mature stands to promote herbaceous ground cover growth, especially near source populations.",oral,Cottam Awards,2022,NA
4,Modeling Pronghorn Behavior and Space-use: Acclimation of Translocated Pronghorn in The Edwards Plateau,"Translocation is the most widely used tool to combat megafauna population declines to prevent extinction. However, despite widespread use, there are no explicit measures for translocation success. To alleviate challenges, it is essential to define appropriate timescales to assess translocation success. We assessed the post-translocation acclimation period for translocated pronghorn (Antilocapra americana). In February 2019, Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) collared 20 resident pronghorn on Rocker b Ranch, near Big Lake, Texas. In January 2020, TPWD translocated 115 pronghorn from Pampa, Texas, to the Rocker b Ranch. We affixed Global Positioning Systems collars on 44 of the 115 translocated pronghorn. We postulated that residents would maintain a static range size over time, whereas translocated pronghorn would initially have large range sizes that declined as they acclimated. We fit weekly utilization distribution (UD) using a kernel density estimator to understand pronghorn space-use and post-translocation behavior. We used the 75% isopleth of each UD to collate a time series of each individual’s weekly range size. We then used generalized linear mixed models to quantify differences between resident and translocated pronghorn behavior through time. We found that the acclimation period for translocated pronghorn is approximately 6 months post-release, much longer than previously thought. In addition, translocated pronghorn settled into smaller ranges than residents. This supports the notion that memory is a primary factor in pronghorn space use and the success of fence modification efforts and translocations should be evaluated over longer time scales than previously thought.",oral,Cottam Awards,2022,NA
5,NA,"Wind energy is a hazard for avian species, with raptors being especially vulnerable due to flight characteristics, low fecundity, and small population sizes. Swainson’s hawks (Buteo swainsoni) are migratory raptors that inhabit regions of North and South America that may be prime areas for building wind energy facilities. However, little information exists regarding vulnerability of this species to wind turbine mortality, displacement, or other impacts. We equipped 41 adult and juvenile Swainson’s hawks with satellite transmitters and tracked them across multiple years; we compared transmitter data to locations of wind facilities to assess risk. We could not find reliable wind facility locations internationally, so we used satellite imagery to identify suspected and confirmable wind turbines throughout the migration route and wintering range. To further assess risk, we used transmitter and wind turbine locations to model resource selection and resource selection probability functions throughout the global range. We found 26,258 wind turbines that might present a hazard to tracked hawks, with most turbine facilities being located on the breeding range. However, most hawk locations (90%) did not occur in collision-risk buffers, and those that did were also mostly (98%) on the breeding range; models agreed with the result that the breeding range presents the most significant risk from this industry. Swainson’s hawks have rarely been found dead at turbine facilities though, perhaps because of their hunting style (i.e., flights low to the ground, perching on the ground, and diving from perches) and adaptability to changing landscape conditions.",oral,Cottam Awards,2022,NA
6,"Identifying Behavioral States of Ocelots, Bobcats, And Coyotes Using Hidden Markov Models","Describing the behavior of carnivores is essential to understanding their ecology. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate field data on behavior of carnivores. Advances in monitoring technology have provided the ability to obtain reliable, high-frequency data on wildlife. From these data, behavioral states can be approximated by analyzing angle and distance between locations. We monitored 12 ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), 19 bobcats (Lynx rufus), and 5 coyotes (Canis latrans) on the East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch and the Yturria Ranch in South Texas, USA, that were fitted with a GPS collar that collected locations every 30 minutes. We characterized behavioral states using hidden Markov models. We assumed low turning angles and longer step lengths to represent patrolling territory, larger turning angles with shorter distances between successive points would represent hunting behavior, and low angles and minimal movement would indicate periods of rest. We predicted 1) each species exhibits three behavioral states: resting, hunting and territory patrolling, 2) ocelots moved further (i.e. territory patrolling) in open areas and rested in dense cover 3) bobcats and coyotes would remain in more open areas than ocelots. We found that ocelots remained closer to heavy cover when resting and foraging and used open areas more when patrolling territory. Bobcats and coyotes remained closer to open areas when foraging and patrolling and overall used open areas at a greater extent. Identifying behavior in the field improves our understanding of the ecology of these species and can target conservation efforts to manage habitat for various behaviors.

7,"Impacts of Woody Plant Removal on Wintering Grassland Bird Communities and Habitat Characteristics in The Marfa Grasslands, Texas","Grassland birds are one of the most imperiled avian groups in North America, having declined consistently and at higher rates than any other group of birds in the continent over the past seventy years. This loss is primarily attributed to the disappearance of suitable habitat, both on the breeding and wintering grounds. Approximately 90% of migratory grassland bird species that breed on North America’s Great Plains spend the winter in the Chihuahuan Desert. However, the encroachment of woody plants into grasslands degrades and changes suitable habitat into desert shrublands, contributing to the decline of grassland bird populations. To evaluate how grassland birds respond to habitat restoration efforts, I conducted bird and vegetation surveys on a ranch in the Marfa grasslands of West Texas. In the summer of 2019, approximately 1,619 ha of this private property was treated with an aerial herbicide spray. The ranch was divided into three stratum types (i.e., grassland, untreated, and herbicide-treated), and bird and vegetation surveys were conducted within each stratum during the winters of 2019-2021. The objectives of this research were to 1) estimate wintering grassland bird abundance in grassland plots, herbicide-treated plots, and untreated shrubland plots over three years of sampling, and 2) assess how treatment for woody plant removal influences habitat characteristics and the structure of wintering bird communities. This information will help us understand if using herbicide to remove woody plants is an effective way to restore grassland ecosystems and threatened grassland bird groups in the Chihuahuan Desert.",oral,A1: Avian Ecology and Management,2022,NA
8,Living at Home: Assessing Inclusive Fitness Benefits Associated with Resource Sharing in A Familial Flocking Songbird,"Kin-selection theory proposes that survival of related individuals increases indirect fitness through the passing of shared genes. However, in avian populations that congregate with extended relatives, there is debate as to how far kin-selection is favored when the proportion of shared genes decreases. Thus, the ability to examine closely and distantly related individuals could elucidate if inclusive fitness benefits are gained by individuals participating in various social flocks. To understand the benefits (or lack thereof) for members engaging in social flocks with relatives, particularly regarding resource sharing, I studied a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagged population of black-crested titmice (Baeolophus atricristatus, BCTI), a songbird that frequently interacts with close (~50% shared genes) and extended (<50% shared genes) relatives. I PIT-tagged BCTI in San Marcos, Texas and deployed 12 radio frequency identification (RFID) feeder stations between January 2019-April 2020. Of the 451 PIT-tagged BCTI, 61 individuals were recorded at feeding stations, comprising 24 close family groups (male, female, offspring) and 16 lineages (extended relatives). The observed proportion of feeding bouts where extended family shared resources was lower than expected (n = 1,344; p < 0.01). However, the duration of feeding bouts when extended kin were present was significantly longer than when unrelated individuals were present (n = 1,298; p = 0.02). Therefore, results from this study suggest related BCTI share resources in a “quality over quantity” (time over frequency) manner which may ultimately increase inclusive fitness of participating individuals.",oral,A1: Avian Ecology and Management,2022,NA
9,No Differences in Body Size and Condition of Purple Martins Along an Urban-rural Gradient in Texas,"Purple Martins (Progne subis) are a New World insectivorous passerine species that are in decline across their entire range. The eastern subspecies is almost entirely dependent on human provided nest structures, which are increasingly being provided by “landlords” in urban settings. In response, Purple Martins have expanded their ranges into cities, yet little is known about the physiology of urban populations. Previous studies on avian body condition across urban-rural gradients have been conflicting, and almost always focus on granivorous species. In this study, I captured Purple Martins (n = 83) at 12 nesting sites across central Texas. For each bird, I measured mass, muscle and fat score, skull length, wing chord, and tail length. I used these measures to calculate a Scaled Mass Index for each individual, as well as calculating an Urban Land Use Index for each nesting site. I used generalized linear modeling to test the relationship between Urban Land Use Index and Scaled Mass Index, mass, muscle score, fat score, and skull length within sex. I found no significant difference in any measure of body size and condition across an urban-rural gradient, suggesting that urban and rural habitats may provide equal resource opportunities for breeding Purple Martins. These data provide evidence that conservation opportunities for Purple Martins exist within urban habitats, with little physiological impact on individuals.",oral,A1: Avian Ecology and Management,2022,NA
10,Avian Productivity in South Texas Rangelands,"Declining grassland bird distribution and abundance has raised the need for management efforts. Very little native grassland remains in the United States, and much of it is used for livestock grazing. Cattle affect the local environment and wildlife communities, although studies relating cattle grazing and grassland birds on a multi-species level are lacking. Fewer studies have assessed productivity specifically in relation to grazing. Grazing may affect suitable avian breeding territories through altering vegetation structure, density, and composition. This study assessed the effects of cattle grazing on bird communities by comparing bird productivity and vegetation in a south Texas rangeland. This study was conducted on the East Foundation’s San Antonio Viejo Ranch, Jim Hogg County, Texas using data from a multi-species avian productivity monitoring program. Beginning in 2019, observational monitoring of breeding birds was completed in 15 1600 m2 transects. Overall, species richness was higher on average in 2020 and 2021 than in 2019. Nest success remained steady in 2019 and 2020, and nearly doubled in 2021. Cattle were deferred in 2019 and 2020 due to drought and returned before the 2021 breeding season. This aligns with the increase in nest success, indicating that there may be a relationship between allowing pastures to rest after extreme weather events and higher avian productivity. Gaining a better understanding of the relationship between grazing and the productivity of local bird communities will provide ranchers with more awareness of the land they manage and how to maintain biodiversity, which can be indicative of ecosystem health.",oral,A1: Avian Ecology and Management,2022,NA
11,Burrowing Owl Prey Delivery,"Determining the diet of species that nest underground, such as the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) is challenging. Prey information for Burrowing Owls is often limited to examining prey remains at nest sites and in owl pellets, collecting images from above-ground trail cameras, or directly observing prey acquisition and delivery. We equipped an artificial nest box and burrows at Rio Bosque Wetlands Park in El Paso, Texas with digital video recorders (DVRs) and three underground infrared cameras to document nesting behaviors and prey use. Herein we document the types and frequencies of prey items delivered inside the nest box during the 2019 nesting season as reflected in videos and images collected continuously from 1 April - 5 July. We reviewed 23,039 video files and documented 580 prey deliveries. We identified 463 (80%) prey items to class and 237 (41%) to family. Invertebrates made up 75% and vertebrates 25% of the identifiable prey items by frequency. A majority (55%) of the invertebrates were insects, especially in the orders Orthoptera and Blattodea, with scorpions (Scorpiones spp.) the second most common group (2% of all items). Vertebrate prey were delivered less commonly and mostly consisted of rodents (14% of all prey items), especially heteromyids, followed by squamate reptiles (6%). Results from this project will aid in conservation and management of this species.",oral,A1: Avian Ecology and Management,2022,NA
12,Burrowing Owl Nest Site Selection,"The burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) is a small owl found in open landscapes throughout North and South America. They nest and roost in burrows, usually excavated by other species. Prairie dogs are the primary creator of burrows in much of their range, and burrowing owl numbers are often linked to prairie dog numbers. In areas with few natural burrows, they will use artificial nests sites such as drain pipes. Since 2013, artificial nest sites (n = 249) have been provided at Rio Bosque Wetland Park, El Paso, TX; material used in the nest sites have varied through time. Artificial nest sites were found to be used more than natural sites (P=0.005); burrow material (P<0.001) and entrance size (P=0.016) also affected use. Mean number of eggs was affected by burrow material (P=0.024) and shade presence (P=0.038). Mean number of owlets and fledglings were not affected by any design choice.

13,Chronic Limitation of Dietary Energy Cues Trade-off Between Optimum Growth and Reproduction in White-tailed Deer,"Morphology varies regionally within species and may induce trade-offs between ontogeny and reproduction. The specific limitation for variable body sizes and signaling trade-offs is assumed to be nutritional quality of the diet but the specific dietary component is unknown. We test how dietary energy affects development and reproduction in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We raised 3 cohorts (n=309) in captivity for 5 years. Individuals were split into a low digestible energy diet (1.77 kcal/g; LE) and a standard digestible energy diet (2.65 kcal/g; SE), both offered ad libitum. We recorded feed consumption per cohort and measured weight, body condition, skeletal size, and antler size annually for each individual until 5 years of age. We also measured reproductive output of females in each treatment. Adults exhibited lower mass and body condition throughout all ages on the LE diet compared to the SE diet. Male antler size and mass was lower across all ages within the LE diet. LE feed consumption was greater across all cohorts and sexes compared to the SE diet. Litter size and fawn birth mass did not differ between treatments. Deer adjusted body condition, body size, and weaponry growth to reduce energy requirements but maintained the same level of reproductive output. Our results provide experimental confirmation for hypotheses regarding life-history trade-offs between growth and reproduction. Digestible energy concentration in the diet should be investigated as a factor explaining regional differences in morphology, especially in systems where individuals cannot maintain population performance under nutrient limitation.",oral,B1: Big Game Ecology,2022,NA
14,Factors Influencing Scaling Relationships of Body and Antler Mass in White-tailed Deer,"Antlers are a costly trait that require skeletal reserves to grow to a large size. Thus, insight into variation in antler size requires understanding the connection between antler and body size. Maternal condition during gestation influences body size and is speculated to influence antler size. Maternal effects might decline with age as individuals might make up for size deficits through compensatory growth. We sought insight into the influence that maternal attributes and diet had on body-antler size relationships throughout ontogeny and at discrete ages. We also examined whether maternal effects were most apparent in younger-aged individuals. We had access to data on maternal characteristics, body mass, and antler mass from captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) that were assigned to either a low energy (1.77 kcal/gm) or standard energy diet (2.67 kcal/gm) from the time they were weaned. We tested if maternal effects from dam age at birth and litter type effected body-antler size relationships. Litter type influenced both intercept (P < 0.001) and slope (P < 0.001) in deer that were 1.5 years old. Our findings show that antler size exhibits a larger percentage increase than body size in deer aged 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 years, both for deer fed a standard energy and low energy diet. Litter type was influential for younger-aged males, thus lending support to the idea that maternal effects diminish with age and that males can likely make up for some of the nutritional deficits early in life through compensatory growth.",oral,B1: Big Game Ecology,2022,NA
15,Quality or Quantity? Ambient Temperature Influences Selection for Shade Quality in A Large Herbivore,"Heat stress is common in endotherms, and behavioral changes to mitigate heat stress are energetically cheaper than physiological responses. Seeking shade can decrease radiant heat gain by 30%. However, all shade is not equal. We designed a manipulative experiment assessing shade quality’s influence on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) space use. Our objectives were: 1) quantify deer shade preference and 2) define temperature thresholds at which shade quality was important. We offered captive deer varying qualities of shade in South Texas during summers 2020 and 2021. Two deer were placed in a 7.6-m2, open-air research pen with 4 treatment areas: 1) 0% shade, 2) 30% shade, 3) 60% shade, and 4) 90% shade created with commercial shade cloth. Trials consisted of a 3-day acclimation period followed by 3 days of data collection during 14 trials. We recorded ambient temperature and quantified deer space use during solar noon ± 1 hr with time-lapse cameras. Average ambient temperature during trials was 35.5℃. Generalized linear mixed models indicated preference for greater shade quality as ambient temperature increased. However, predicted deer use was similar for all shade qualities until ambient temperature reached 29℃ at which point 90% shade was preferred. Proportional use of shade treatments: 1) 0% shade, 2) 30% shade, 3) 60% shade, and 4) 90% shade was 7%, 6%, 17%, and 70%, respectively. Understanding animal needs is crucial to manage for beneficial resources. Our results indicate shade quality is important to deer. Thus, land managers should consider thermal cover when designing management plans.",oral,B1: Big Game Ecology,2022,NA
16,Using Mule Deer Movement to Inform Management in A Novel Chronic Wasting Disease Cluster,"In 2021, the distribution of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) dramatically increased in Texas highlighting a need for a deeper understanding of factors that influence the disease spread. Juvenile dispersal is considered an important parameter in CWD epidemiology, but juvenile movement and drivers of dispersal are poorly understood. The Canadian River corridor is adjacent to a recently identified CWD cluster and may facilitate movement connecting regions of New Mexico with unknown CWD prevalence with the Texas Panhandle. We GPS-collared 30 nine-month-old mule deer, located within a newly established CWD containment zone, to study movement and dispersal patterns. To identify movements that may have enhanced disease risk, we first calculated net squared displacement across individuals to assign resident or non-resident status. We then used velocity, duration, distance, and fidelity, to categorize non-residential movements as either exploratory or dispersal. Currently, 23% of our individuals have exhibited non-residential movement including two dispersals and five exploratory movements. Mean dispersal and exploratory movement lengths were 33.64 ± 26.25 km (x̄ ± SE) and 83.88 ± 40.80 km, respectively. Resident velocity averaged 80.47 ± 0.49 m/hr compared to non-residential individuals at 88.31 ± 1.84 m/hr overall but 118.23 ± 43.10 m/hr during non-residential movements. These results demonstrate potential for large-scale movements by juvenile deer facilitating disease spread throughout the region. With CWD becoming an increasing issue across Texas, evident by recently updated management strategies, understanding movement ecology of susceptible species should be of primary concern.",oral,B1: Big Game Ecology,2022,NA
17,Sociospatial Organization of Nilgai Antelope in South Texas,"Nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are an exotic ungulate species with over 30,000 free-ranging individuals in South Texas. Although nilgai have been present in Texas for almost a century, there is little information on the movements, behaviors, and social interactions of nilgai. Recently, there has been increased interest in nilgai ecology due to their role as a competent host for cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and R. (B.) annulatus), which can negatively affect the livestock industry. The social interactions of nilgai can aid in the understanding of population dynamics, space use, and disease transmission. The goals of this study were to: 1) estimate home and core range sizes of nilgai and 2) investigate the spatiotemporal overlap among nilgai dyads. We used hourly locations of 40 GPS-collared nilgai to help understand the interaction of individuals with overlapping ranges. Overall, nilgai had large and highly variable annual home ranges (female range = 105- 1,545 ha; male range = 221-1,602 ha). The annual median core range estimate for females was 108 ha (22-225) and for males 205 ha (46-219). We analyzed dynamic interactions of 64 nilgai dyads that had ≥ 10% overlap of core ranges. We observed dyads interacting closely for several days to weeks, followed by a multi-day or week separation, then interactions resumed. Large home ranges by nilgai challenge the sustainability of CFT eradication efforts in the U.S. Therefore, understanding how individuals interact with one another within their home ranges can provide insight for disease management strategies.",oral,B1: Big Game Ecology,2022,NA
18,Habitat Selection and Movement Behavior of Mule Deer Using an Integrated Step Selection Analysis in Black Gap Wildlife Management Area,"Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations have declined due to habitat loss or fragmentation. Little is known about the habitat needs of mule deer in the extreme arid environments of their range. This project aims to look at how habitat selection changes for mule deer in more extreme environments. Understanding this will allow managers to adapt practices to these extreme environments. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department translocated fourteen female mule deer ranging from 1.5 to 8.5 years of age, from Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area to Black Gap Wildlife Management Area (BGWMA) as a population reduction effort. The translocated mule deer were fitted with GPS collars programmed to collect a location every three hours. We used an Integrated Step Selection Analysis (iSSA) to examine the effects of habitat conditions on both movement and habitat selection, including slope, aspect, ruggedness, and elevation. Mule deer selected for habitat that was higher in elevation and selected against rugged terrain. Movement rates were lower in rugged terrain. These results suggest that mule deer may prefer higher elevation to avoid extreme heat. Also, mule deer may avoid rugged terrain because it is harder to search for food and more difficult to avoid predators in these areas. Session C1",oral,B1: Big Game Ecology,2022,NA
19,Transformational Wildlife Funding-Recovering America's Wildlife Act,"Transformational wildlife funding was last seen in 1937 with the Wildlife Restoration Act (Pittman- Robertson Act). The Recovering America's Wildlife Act (HR 2773; S 2372) now before Congress would bring more than $50 million to Texas annually. Passage of this bill would provide permanent, dedicated funding to restore sensitive fish and wildlife populations, create and enhance educational programs, and improve nature- based outdoor recreation. The bill is supported by a national alliance of conservation and business groups. This presentation will include details of the funding, the organizations and networks that support and don’t support the bill, and how TCTWS, your organization, and biologists can support this national and state-wide initiative, regardless of your employer. Even in “today’s politically charged” environment, this effort is getting bipartisan support in Congress. Whatever your interests, be a part of the solution and this historic legislation.",oral,C1: Humans and Wildlife,2022,NA
20,Investigating How Relational Values Influence Landowner Participation in An Endangered Species Conservation Program,"Research investigating the interface of landowners and endangered species conservation (ESC) identifies environmental stewardship as a cornerstone principle encouraging sustainable human-nature relationships. Stewardship-oriented relationships are complex, however, as they are associated with diverse relational values reflecting a landowner’s subjective evaluation of the meanings attached to human-nature relationships. Relational values convey meaning through landowner preferences, principles, and virtues about human-nature relationships and are supported or undermined by policymaking. Thus, relational values must be accounted for by policymakers as institutional ESC strategies, like Voluntary incentive programs (VIPs) espouse values that interfere with or encourage landowner relationships. Value alignment between ESC policy- mechanisms and relational values are key to enhancing the success of VIPs but research indicates that VIPs often fail to align with landowner values and, thus, fall short in securing adequate levels of ESC. We conducted 24 interviews with Texas landowners to analyze VIP alignment with landowner values. Results revealed that landowners’ human-nature relationships were characterized by relational values such as active management, stewardship, and self-determination. VIPs aligned with preferences for stewardship and management but directly conflicted with landowner self-determination. The rules and requirements of VIPs opposed values of autonomy and social responsibility and failed to provide incentives to overcome such value conflicts. Thus, the VIP we investigated exemplifies the rift between hegemonically designed and implemented VIPs and the values motivating voluntary ESC. Bridging this gap requires coordinated efforts between researchers and policymakers to identify and incorporate landowner values into new incentive structures that enhance and enable diverse, non- instrumental values driving ESC.",oral,C1: Humans and Wildlife,2022,NA
21,The Long-standing Significance of Genetic Diversity in Conservation,"Since allozymes were first used to assess genetic diversity in the 1960s and 1970s, biologists have attempted to characterize gene pools and conserve the diversity observed in domestic crops, livestock, zoos and (more recently) natural populations. Recently, some authors have claimed that the importance of genetic diversity in conservation biology has been greatly overstated. Here, we argue that a voluminous literature indicates otherwise. We address four main points made by detractors of genetic diversity's role in conservation by using published literature to firmly establish that genetic diversity is intimately tied to evolutionary fitness, and that the associated demographic consequences are of paramount importance to many conservation efforts. We think that responsible management in the Anthropocene should, whenever possible, include the conservation of ecosystems, communities, populations, individuals, and their underlying genomic diversity.",oral,C1: Humans and Wildlife,2022,NA
22,Effects of The Covid-19 Lockdown on The Soundscape of The Wild Basin Wilderness Preserve,"The COVID-19 shutdown provided an opportunity for analysis of the natural world under unusual conditions. The Wild Basin Wilderness Preserve was closed to the public for 6 months during the 2020 shutdown. We hypothesized that reduced human activity during that time would result in a measurable reduction in anthropogenic noise levels and that this in turn may have a quantifiable effect on the soundscape used by many of the native species at Wild Basin. In order to test this hypothesis, we established five acoustic recording locations spread across the preserve and one video location near Texas Highway 360 while working as essential personnel during the 2020 lockdown. We used a handheld recorder and camera to collect acoustic and visual data. When the preserve was reopened to the public in 2021, the study was replicated, with all recordings matched to the 2020 dates and times. Our 11-week analysis in 2020 and 2021 indicated that Wild Basin was significantly quieter during the 2020 shutdown. In addition to being quieter, analysis indicated that the acoustic complexity index of 2020 was greater than 2021. This suggests that a greater variety of sounds could be heard at Wild Basin in the absence of anthropogenic noise (i.e traffic and construction noise). In summary, anthropogenic noise significantly alters the soundscape of the Wild Basin Wilderness Preserve. Protecting the soundscape of Wild Basin, and natural areas more generally, may be a critical element for sustaining our native species.",oral,C1: Humans and Wildlife,2022,NA
23,A Moderated Peer-to-peer Prescribed Fire Outreach Program for Texas Hill Country Landowners,"Traditional extension and outreach programs provide information from an expert to participants, but effectively educating today’s landowners and land managers may require new methods. This study investigated the Peers and Pros 360° teaching method through designing, conducting, and evaluating 3 workshops for landowners in the Edwards Plateau ecoregion about prescribed fire. Peers and Pros 360° is a moderated peer-to- peer teaching method where participants exchange ideas within a framework prepared by professionals. This framework consists of a designated topic, themes, and statements. Our program consisted of 8 themes, each with 3 associated statements that represented frequent comments heard by fire professionals, regardless of whether those comments are factual. During the program, participants were asked to react to these statements. Landowners with more prescribed fire experience often led the discussions, while those who were not as familiar with the topic could ask questions and learn from their peers. Following the discussion, professionals contributed additional information based on a list of predetermined talking points. Results of the study indicate 93% of participants preferred Peers and Pros 360° over traditional teaching methods, participants at all 3 workshops experienced an increase in knowledge, and 100% of participants enjoyed learning from their peers. These results and this program model will be useful to outreach and extension professionals in designing and conducting relevant programs that effectively encourage long-term, positive change.",oral,C1: Humans and Wildlife,2022,NA
24,Songbird Behavior and Conservation in the Anthropocene,"The presence and success of a diverse community of songbird species is frequently used as an indicator of ecosystem quality and health. Conversely, declines in species richness and population sizes often tell us when things are not well. But many of these trends are a result of adaptive or maladaptive behaviors that have evolved over many generations. In some cases, established behavioral response systems no longer facilitate success in altered environments, and may underly poor vital rates and management failures. Thus, a basic understanding of songbird behavior, including the rate at which behavioral changes can occur and the physical and physiological limits to plasticity, is a requirement for anyone interested in maintaining healthy songbird populations. But, our world is changing rapidly, and range-wide declines in many species suggest that behavioral compensation may occur too slowly to avoid negative population-level impacts. To maintain viable populations in many species, our conservation strategies must be broader and more intentional in regards to songbird behavior. For example, focusing on the vegetative quality of habitats may not be enough. We must also manage the sensory landscape to ensure that vital cue-response systems remain intact. Other anthropogenic factors are also altering how birds select mates and habitats, sometimes in ways that decrease fitness. The goal of this talk is to explore the role of behavior in conservation and management, and to introduce a recently published book that takes a deep dive into these topics.

25,On Understanding Anuran Communities: Sampling Acoustic Data for the Probability of Detection of Species Presence,"Frogs are cryptic animals that are sensitive to abiotic changes in their environment. The calling phenologies of frogs can be useful tools to determine the species’ detection probability. Frogs call for a variety of reasons, the most important being in attracting a mate and breeding. Occupancy models can be built by allowing for environmental factors to explain the presence or absence of a species during a survey at a specific site. Ten species of anurans have been monitored for seven years in Colorado County, Texas. My project focuses on the environmental factors that influence the calling phenology of the Cricket frog (Acris blanchardi), Green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), Striped chorus frog (Pseudacris fouquettei), Eastern narrowmouth toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis), Southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus), Crawfish frog (Lithobates areolatus), Gulf coast toad (Incilius nebulifer), American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), Green frog (Lithobates clamitans), and Squirrel treefrog (Hyla squirella) in 2015. I used acoustic data recorded at eleven variable sites to determine the detection probability of each species. I collected weather conditions from the local weather station. There was 127.16 cm of accumulated precipitation during the year, and the air temperature ranged from -3.9 ºC to 39.4 ºC. I used the acoustic data of frogs calling at these sites coupled with these environmental covariates to build occupancy models. These models demonstrate what influences or prevents frogs calling, and when frogs are most likely to call during the year. The single-season occupancy models demonstrate when and where sampling effort will be most successful.",oral,D1: Amphibians and Reptiles I,2022,NA
26,Detectability of Spot-Tailed Earless Lizards by Various Methods and Lizard Densities,"Spot-tailed earless lizards (STEL; Holbrookia lacerata and H. subcaudalis) are an elusive and potentially rare species, which are currently being considered for threatened status by the USFWS. To assist with federal listing, we investigated the best methods to detect STEL when present in an area. Also we determined if a specific density of STEL was needed to reach a threshold for detectability. We wild-caught 20 Plateau and 20 Tamaulipan STEL and held them in captivity until released within a 1-ha outdoor enclosure, which was subdivided into 100, 10 x 10-m quadrats. We randomly selected 45 quadrats and constructed one treatment (i.e., camera traps, light traps, rock piles, cover boards, pitfall array, funnel traps, detector dog, visual search, and road cruising) per quadrat with 5 replications. We placed 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 STEL into the enclosure and conducted 3 searches per density. STEL’s were observed during road cruising and visual searches. STEL’s were not observed in funnel traps, camera traps, rock piles, cover boards, and lights. Only one STEL was captured in a pitfall trap, but was killed by fire ants. Detector dog was unsuccessful in locating STEL’s; perhaps the lizards do not produce enough scent for dogs to acquire a scent. STEL detectability increased with increasing STEL density but not in a proportional manner. At any time of day, about 42% of STEL were above ground, making only 25% potentially detectable. Therefore, a searcher must look within appropriate habitat and the correct time to locate STEL.",oral,D1: Amphibians and Reptiles I,2022,NA
27,Using Museum Collections and Citizen Science to Investigate Changes in Species Distributions in Texas,"Knowledge of species distributions are fundamental to species conservation. Patterns of distribution can change through time due to dispersal, translocation, and extirpation. Trends in the distribution patterns of wide ranging Texas species can be investigated when both a large historical and large recent dataset are available. The historical dataset of herpetofauna has previously been summarized into county distribution maps for Texas. Recent observations are now available through the citizen science platform called iNaturalist. Using these datasets, both with more than 100,000 specimens/observations, we can now compare the current distributions of species (2013-2020) to those specimens housed in museum collections (1850-2013). We found that of the 94 species of Texas amphibians and reptiles examined that 40 had a contracting distribution, 42 were stable, and 12 had an expanding distribution. Trends within taxonomic groups indicated that Frogs, Salamanders, and Lizards were contracting while both snakes and turtles were stable. Geographically, the regions with counties that appear to have the biggest change in number of contracting species and therefore have likely lost the most species are within the cross timbers, blackland prairie and post oak savannah ecosystems.",oral,D1: Amphibians and Reptiles I,2022,NA
28,Mapping Dunes Sagebrush Lizard Habitat,"The dunes sagebrush lizard (DSL; Sceloporus arenicolus) is a habitat specialist endemic to the Mescalero- Monahans shinnery-sands ecosystem of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, over which land-use practices have contributed to fragmentation and loss of habitat. We created a fine-scale, continuous habitat suitability model for the DSL in Texas to support conservation actions. We used generalized linear (GLM) and spatially weighted generalized additive models (GAM) to predict DSL occurrence. We included sand cover, shinnery oak cover, binned rugosity, and mean maximum rugosity as covariates. We replicated our model selection analysis and our spatial prediction analysis across a random sample of pseudo-absence data, then selected the best ranking model, defined as the model having the highest frequency being ranked first across 1,000 replications. Finally, we used the averaged prediction, from the replicated model prediction runs (n=1,000), as our estimate of occurrence for each grid cell. The highest-ranked model was the mean maximum rugosity and percent cover shinnery oak interaction model. The distribution of predicted occurrence captured Winkler County well in the GLM, but Andrews County had a lower predicted probability than expected. The GAM accounted for DSL spatial dynamics; thus, we see a higher occurrence probability in Andrews County and a much lower occurrence probability in Crane County compared to the GLM. The GLM is important for identifying areas of potential DSL habitat, allowing us to identify areas for future surveys. The GAM could determine areas for high-value conservation actions, such as protecting dune habitat from further development.",oral,D1: Amphibians and Reptiles I,2022,NA
29,NA,"Rare and secretive snake species with low occupancy and detection rates are expensive and difficult to monitor and study using traditional box traps, especially on private lands where daily access to box traps can be a burden to landowners or barrier to their participation. Advancements in camera trap technology have provided wildlife researchers with more efficient techniques to monitor such species, like the federally listed Louisiana Pinesnake (Pituophis ruthveni) and Eastern Indigo Snake (Drymarchon couperi), without the burden of daily trap checks. Here, we apply those established camera trap monitoring techniques to survey for the Western Massasauga (Sistrurus tergeminus) on private lands in a grassland ecosystem. We report results on detection of the target species and summarize insights gained within the context of estimating occupancy parameters of rare and secretive snake species in general. In short, camera trapping was effective at detecting many grassland snake species (n = 13), including the target species, with obvious implications for long-term monitoring of those populations. In addition, spatial patterns of detection appeared to be best explained by a subtle variation in soil type across the survey area, although additional research is needed to confirm this observation. This study demonstrates 1) the utility of these established camera trapping techniques in a different ecosystem (i.e., grasslands), and 2) an increased ability to detect the Western Massasauga on private lands with a small research footprint.",oral,D1: Amphibians and Reptiles I,2022,NA
30,Daily Emergence Behavior of Captive Spot-Tailed Earless Lizards,"Spot-tailed earless lizards (STEL; Holbrookia lacerata and H. subcaudalis) are an elusive species that spends much of the diel cycle underground, which makes them even more difficult to locate. In conducting surveys for STEL, we noted that they emerge during daytime after cloud cover clears, temperature increases, and ultraviolent light (UV) and light intensity are near peak levels. Therefore, we tested this theory by controlling each of the above factors in laboratory experiments. Fifteen STEL were wild-caught and individually housed in 38-L aquaria and provided crickets and water ad libitum. Aquaria were equipped with heat lamps, UV lights, LED lights, and video cameras. Aquaria received either heat lamp, UV light, LED light, darkness, or combination of UV and LED lights for 3 days, which was turned on at 0730, and time of emergence was recorded. STEL immediately emerged (P < 0.03) with a combination of UV and LED lights, followed by delayed emergence with UV light and LED light only, while emergent behavior became sporadic if provided heat or darkness. In a second experiment, STEL were provided UV and LED light, but the onset of light began at either 8am, 10am, or noon. STEL emerged upon lights turning on (P < 0.02) irrespective of time. STEL emerged upon lights turning on 81% of time, within 30 minutes 11% of time, within 1 hr 6% of time, and only 2% of lizards emerged after 1 hr. STEL react to and became active aboveground with higher light intensity and UV index. Session A2",oral,D1: Amphibians and Reptiles I,2022,NA
31,Characteristics of Texas Quail Hunting,"Due to declining quail numbers, in 2011 there were public requests for Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) to limit the bag or season length in order to reduce the harvest, or to even close the season completely. Limited TPWD data showed that the bag would need to be reduced significantly to have a noticeable effect. This amount of reduction would be unacceptable to an unknown, but possibly high, proportion of hunters. Reducing the season length was a greater unknown, because TPWD did not collect daily harvest data at that time, only seasonal totals, and therefore could not reliably estimate the effects of later starting dates and/or earlier closing dates on harvest. Two projects were created to gather the data necessary to evaluate the potential regulation changes. The first was a survey that looked at February hunting and self-imposed restrictions on hunting activities, while the second was a multi-year study that examined the distribution of bag, and the distribution of hunting effort and harvest across a season. While a majority of hunters reported hunting in February, other months had higher hunter and harvest estimates. Hunters reported restricting themselves more than landowners did. No significant differences were found in hunters from different regions of the state. 13.43% of reported bags had >12 quail. Reducing the daily bag limit to 10 would result in a 11.14% decrease in harvest in an average year; reduction to 8 would give a 25.56% reduction.",oral,A2: Gamebird Ecology and Management,2022,NA
32,Distributional Responses of Northern Bobwhites to Hunting Pressure in South Texas,"Habitat selection and the localized distributions of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) are heavily influenced by the availability of usable space. However, the influence of harvest and associated hunting pressures on the selection of usable space is unknown. We analyzed the relationships between spatial aspects of bobwhite hunting variables among the changes in bobwhite distributions at 16-ha resolution during the hunting seasons in 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021. We calculated changes in bobwhite distributions using multi-temporal density surface models from line transect distance sampling surveys and collected spatial attributes of hunting variables (i.e., harvest, hunts, gunshots) using GPS units on dogs and hunting vehicles. The annual harvest was 20% of the November bobwhite density estimate, with total gun hours ranging from 5.3-gun hours/100-ha to 8.3-gun hours/100-ha. We found that changes in bobwhite densities across hunting seasons were primarily influenced by year, indicating that bobwhite hunting pressures at low intensities have minimal influence on changes in bobwhite densities and distributions during the course of a hunting season. Coincidently, we found a significant negative relationship (r) between localized bobwhite density and each hunting parameter during the peak hunting period (i.e., mid-December to late January). We assume this relationship indicates that hunting pressure and harvest parameters at higher intensities will have a stronger influence on bobwhite distributional response.",oral,A2: Gamebird Ecology and Management,2022,NA
33,Connecting the Dots: A Social-Ecological Assessment of the Northern Bobwhite Decline in Texas,"Networks are a universal component of life and occur in a variety of places such as cells, roadways, and communication systems. In ecology, networks occur as habitat patches connected by corridors and as metapopulations connected by dispersal. Networks also occur with stakeholders concerned with these habitats and populations. Thus, conservation could be viewed as a suite of interconnected networks comprised of habitat, wildlife, and people that form a social-ecological system. Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) is a species that has experienced long-term population declines across its geographic distribution. Researchers have investigated this decline primarily from a habitat-loss or population-growth perspective, but rarely from a human-dimension perspective and never as a social-ecological system. Our study investigates the bobwhite decline in Texas as a social-ecological system using a network perspective. Our study focuses on northern and southern Texas where we will quantify and interrelate habitat connectivity, bobwhite-population growth, and stakeholder perspectives. Here we present findings of a pilot survey conducted with 3 stakeholder groups (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department biologists, land managers, and quail hunters) in each region (n = 30 respondents/region). We documented notable differences between ecoregions regarding stakeholder perspectives and beliefs of the bobwhite decline. This project represents a first approximation analysis of the bobwhite decline as a social- ecological system and will provide an analytical framework for conservation that can be used with other species.",oral,A2: Gamebird Ecology and Management,2022,NA
34,Variance in Clutch Size and Egg Morphology of Lesser Prairie-Chickens Across a Climate Gradient,"Lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) are distributed from southeast New Mexico to south- central Kansas. This range encompasses a temperature and precipitation gradient that is hotter and drier in the southwest to cooler and wetter in the northeast. We hypothesized lesser prairie-chickens may vary clutch sizes or egg morphology as an adaptation to local environmental conditions. We compared clutch sizes and morphometric characteristics of lesser prairie-chicken eggs among study areas in Texas and Kansas. We used analysis of variance tests to compare clutch sizes, and egg metrics of length, width, volume, surface area, deviation from an ellipse, and mass. We also compared egg coloration and extent of speckling. Lesser prairie- chickens in Texas set significantly fewer eggs per clutch (mean 6.7 ± 1.75 SD) compared to those in Kansas (mean 10.3 ± 2.36 SD). We found eggs from the Texas study area were larger, with greater volume than any of the Kansas study areas and had a greater mass than two of three Kansas study areas. Visual appearance also differed; Texas eggs were lighter toned in shell color but had a greater frequency of speckling than Kansas eggs. Our results suggest that lesser prairie-chickens in Texas put greater investment in fewer but larger eggs per clutch. The lower surface to volume ratios of larger eggs translates to reduced evapotranspiration compared to smaller eggs. It appears that lesser prairie-chickens in the southwestern extent of their distribution may be responding to the hotter and drier climate through modification of clutch sizes and egg morphology.

35,The Effect of 60 Years of Translocations on Populations of Texas Desert Bighorn Sheep,"In Texas, desert bighorn sheep (DBS, Ovis canadensis) historically occupied 16 mountain ranges in the Trans-Pecos Region. Described as O. c. texianus in 1912, this subspecies of DBS was extirpated in the 1950s due to overharvesting, competition, and diseases. Historical restocking efforts have depended on translocating individuals of O. c. nelsoni and O. c. mexicana from Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, and Mexico and from in-state locations. These efforts reestablished populations from <14 individuals in 1959 to >1,500 individuals across 11 mountain ranges by 2020. The effects of these inter- and intrastate translocations on the genetic and genomic composition of contemporary populations are unknown. Mitochondrial markers (Cytochrome b, Cytb; Displacement loop, D-loop) and double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq) was used to determine the subspecific status of known pre-extirpated individuals and population structure, genetic variation, and connectivity in contemporary populations, respectively. To date, the Cytb gene has been successfully sequenced from 11 of 23 pre-1960 bone samples, indicating that pre-extirpated DBS represent a ‘desert-like’ subspecies (O. c. mexicana, O. c. nelsoni, and O. c. texiana) rather than the Rocky Mountain subspecies (O. c. canadensis). From preliminary analyses using ddRADSeq data, DBS west of 104° (Sierra Diablo, Beach, Baylor, and Van Horn Mountains) are similar in the nuclear genome to populations in Arizona whereas DBS east of 104° (Elephant Mountain, Black Gap, Dove, and Bassey Mountains) are similar to populations in Nevada. Consequently, reintroduction efforts from multiple out-of-state sources were successful with evidence of detectable contributions to the nuclear genome.",oral,B2: Conservation and Ecology of Mammals I,2022,NA
36,Species-Specific Effectiveness of An Ultrasonic Acoustic Bat Deterrent: Implications for Wind Energy,"An unintended consequence of wind energy is bat fatalities occurring from strikes with turbine blades. Ultrasonic acoustic deterrents (UADs) have been designed to create an unattractive air space for bats surrounding wind turbines, thus allowing maximization of energy production. Our objective was to maximize species effectiveness of the NRG Systems-manufactured UAD through experimental trials in a 61 m x 10 m x 4.5 m (L x W x H) outdoor flight cage located in San Marcos, Texas, USA. Specifically, we released wild-captured bats within the flight cage and compared flight distances each bat flew from the UAD between three treatments and control periods and assessed several echolocation characteristics using six acoustic detector microphones. The three treatments varied in sound emission frequencies: low (20-32 kHz), high (38-50 kHz), and combined (20-50 kHz), and each was interspersed by four-minute control periods. We focused on four species: Myotis velifer (n = 50), Tadarida brasiliensis (n = 77), red bats (Lasiurus blossevilli, L. borealis; n = 45), and Nycticeius humeralis (n = 37) and conducted trials from July-October 2020 and March-May 2021. All species flew greater distances from the UAD during all three UAD emission treatments than during the control periods. Additionally, results suggest that all species altered echolocation during UAD emission. Thus, it may be advantageous to use low frequency emissions for UADs as they attenuate less rapidly and travel further than higher frequencies. We recommend additional testing with a longer flight cage to better understand potential minimum distances various frequencies deter bats.",oral,B2: Conservation and Ecology of Mammals I,2022,NA
37,Activity Patterns and Prey Selection by South Texas Bats,"Bats have a greater diversity of behavior and diet than any other mammalian order. Therefore, understanding activity patterns and prey selection is imperative in the success of maintaining bat populations in south Texas. The emergence of Pseudogymnoascus destructans, a cold-adapted fungus and the causative agent of white-nose syndrome (WNS), has also led to steep declines in some North American bat populations. In more recent studies, conducted on the San Antonio Viejo Ranch belonging to the East Foundation, activity patterns for four summer resident bats was conducted - Eastern Red Bat (Lasirius borealis), Cave Myotis (Myotis velifer), Evening Bat (Nycticeius humeralis), and Brazilian Free-tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis). These results showed peak nightly activity hours for these bats. For all species included in the study, total bat activity peaked at 02:00, with a secondary peak occurring between 05:00 and 06:00. It is crucial to determine how bats respond to changes in vegetation type and species composition given different land uses. From this, we can understand and provide a baseline for activity patterns and prey selection for these south Texas bats to prepare for future disturbances. This lack of information has led me to research effective management strategies needed to protect these vital species in a more comprehensive and cohesive manner than previously understood. This discussion will also cover a review of current literature and gaps in knowledge.",oral,B2: Conservation and Ecology of Mammals I,2022,NA
38,Predictive Occurrence Models for Bat Species in Texas,"Effective conservation and management practices depend on knowledge of species’ distributions and habitat preferences. When compared to other vertebrate groups, bat ecology and distributions remain less well- known. Therefore, predicting habitat suitability is a critical first step in bat conservation. The goal of our study was to map the potential distribution of bat species in Texas and determine environmental variables that best predict a species’ presence. We utilized occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to create presence-only Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution models for bats in Texas. We trimmed data to include only species with more than ten occurrences. We also tested environmental variables for correlation, which left us with ten environmental predictors. The generated models did not predict that any region of Texas was most suitable for bat species, but all models predicted a lack of suitable habitat in the Texas panhandle. The environmental variable that best predicted the most species was annual precipitation, which discriminated between presence and absence of eight species. Our models show elevation was the most important variable in predicting the occurrence of seven of our study species. Distance from water and isothermality both predicted the occurrence of three different species. The remaining species were best predicted by distance from water and annual temperature range. Knowledge on important environmental factors and the maps resulting from our models provide an important foundation for future studies of bat species in Texas by providing information on potential conservation actions or areas appropriate for surveys and/or protection.",oral,B2: Conservation and Ecology of Mammals I,2022,NA
39,"Temporal Resource Partitioning of Aoudad, Desert Bighorn Sheep, and Mule Deer in The Trans-Pecos Region, Texas","Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and exotic aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) inhabit the mountainous regions of the Trans Pecos. Biologists are concerned about resource competition in co-occupied landscapes, specifically between non-native aoudad and Texas’ native ungulates. Arid regions like the Chihuahuan Desert receive little, highly seasonal rainfall, limiting the availability of water and vegetation resources. Ungulates use resources differently depending on seasonal activities (rutting, breeding, lambing, etc.). Limited resources, paired with cycles of ungulate use, may indicate temporal partitioning of resources among these three ungulate species. By examining these cycles through time, we will determine changes in resource importance and how ungulates may partition their use. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department deployed collars on 45 desert bighorn sheep (21 male, 24 female), 59 mule deer (34 male, 25 female, and 41 aoudad (33 male, 8 female) in the Van Horn Mountains from 2019 to 2020. We utilized data from these collars to inspect cyclic patterns in resource use of each species through time using autocorrelation surfaces. We examined cycles in distance to known water sources, percent shrub cover, ruggedness, and escape terrain. Preliminary results show daily cycles using rugged terrain in all ungulate species, with a seasonal shift during spring months in mule deer and aoudad. These results suggest that ungulates’ use of crucial habitats varies on daily and seasonal scales, providing an opportunity for temporal niche partitioning.

40,Diet Preference in Feral Pigs: Comparing Feed Intake and Visitation Rates Among Different Feeds,"Damage caused by wild pigs (Sus scrofa) to agriculture and natural resources increases annually, and information regarding what feeds are most likely to be visited and consumed by wild pigs may improve population reduction methods. Yet, diet choice is influenced by seasonal forage availability and nutrient demands that may differ by sex and gestational status. Whole corn (Zea mays) is widely used as bait for wild pigs. Its effectiveness, however, in attracting pigs can vary seasonally, possibly as different forage options become available. Our goal was to evaluate differences in feed consumption and visitation rates in pigs between corn, other commercial feeds, and food resources available in the Texas Hill Country. Trials were conducted in spring and fall of 2021 at the Kerr Wildlife Management Area. Each trial consisted of 10 pens where pigs were provided a known mass of corn and a known mass of one test feed. Pigs were left to feed for 5 nights while cameras in each pen captured images every 15 seconds. Remaining feed in each trough was weighed, and the number of images with pigs visiting each trough were counted. Preliminary data for total mass consumed and visitation rate indicate that corn was the preferred food resource across all trials in the spring, but the image data also shows that visitation to some test feeds increased over time. These findings may help wildlife managers make informed decisions about what feed types to use when trying to bait feral hogs across different seasons.",oral,C2: Exotic and Invasive Species,2022,NA
41,The Influence of Income and Loss on Hunters’ Attitudes Towards Wild Pigs and Their Management,"Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are one of the most pervasive invasive species in North America. Wild pigs pose a threat to crops, livestock, and the environment, but also offer recreational hunting opportunities. At the same time, stakeholders vary in their attitudes towards wild pigs and their management. We investigated whether loss and income due to wild pigs influence attitudes towards wild pigs and their management in Texas in one of these stakeholder groups (hunters). We further examined how land use influenced attitudes towards wild pigs in hunters who own land. We analyzed 22176 responses (8707 landowners, 13469 non-landowners) to the Texas A&M Human Dimensions of Wild Pigs Survey. Landowners who generated income via wild pigs had more positive attitudes towards wild pigs than those who did not generate income. Landowners who received income further considered government or agency hunting to be a less effective or acceptable method of control. Landowners who used their land for agriculture had more negative attitudes towards wild pigs than those who did not, and considered government or agency hunting to be less effective or acceptable. However, effect sizes for our results were small and, across all groups, attitudes towards wild pigs were generally negative. Very few respondents reported generating income from wild pigs (3.91% of landowners, 0.56% of non-landowners) and reported losses were ~4x greater than income. Additional research on differing values among stakeholder groups may be more likely to shed light on disagreements on wild pig management than variation in wild pig-derived income.",oral,C2: Exotic and Invasive Species,2022,NA
42,Patterns of The Introduction and Spread of The Non-native Brown Widow Spider in The Americas,"Introductions of non-native species to novel environments happen often, but a species must overcome multiple biotic and abiotic filters to establish, and eventually spread, in a new region. Focusing on patterns of introductions can provide insights as to underlying mechanisms that facilitate establishment, and in turn, their potential effects on native communities. The brown widow spider (Latrodectus geometricus) is likely native to Africa, but now has a cosmopolitan distribution due to introductions via international trade. We reviewed the patterns of brown widow introductions in the Americas to determine if there are any large-scale inferences regarding their patterns, and potential impacts, of their introduction. Over 4,000 records from 30 countries were synthesized and demonstrate their spread to higher latitudes across time and an increase in the number of records in the past two decades. Citizen-science databases (e.g., iNaturalist) have been instrumental in documenting the expansion of the brown widow. On a local scale, we also quantified the niche of brown widows relative to other cobweb-weaving spiders along their habitat, diet, and isotopic niche axes while couching their resource use in the context of their functional traits. We found that brown widows exhibit high overlap in their functional traits with native spiders, which could indicate high overlap in resource use. Results from this research will provide insight as to the mechanisms underlying the establishment of a non-native species into a novel ecosystem.",oral,C2: Exotic and Invasive Species,2022,NA
43,Genetic Variation of Invasive Axis Deer in Texas and Other Introduced Populations Globally,"Human-mediated introductions and subsequent establishment and spread of nonnative species has the potential to create a pseudo-founder effect on such populations, which typically results in low genetic diversity and inbreeding. However, several exotic invasive species exhibit a ‘genetic paradox’ in which they thrive, despite inbreeding and low genetic diversity patterns in their introduced range. Axis deer (Axis axis) were introduced to new ranges (Texas, Hawaii, Australia, and Croatia) during the 19th and 20th centuries and successfully established large populations from a few founding individuals. We used mitochondrial (Cytochrome-b, Cytb; Displacement loop, D-loop) and nuclear (10 microsatellites) markers to assess genetic diversity within and between axis deer populations in Texas and Hawaii which were then compared to data from other introduced and native populations. Overall mtDNA divergence was only 0.54% (Cytb) and 1.55% (D-loop) indicating high mitochondrial similarity in the species, with each invasive population composed of only one or two mtDNA haplotypes. Microsatellite allele diversity also was low within and between axis deer populations in Texas and Hawaii with monomorphic loci and multiple violations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both populations. The low genetic diversity in axis deer globally, as well as within and between invasive populations, suggests that introduced axis deer populations experienced founder effects following introduction, yet have successfully established and expanded. Axis deer appear to be another invasive species exhibiting this genetic paradox, where they are wildly successful in certain regions (Texas and Hawaii) yet exhibit poor genetic profiles that suggest long-term population persistence would not be sustainable.",oral,C2: Exotic and Invasive Species,2022,NA
44,NA,"Discrete extreme climatic events are important drivers of individual space use, survival, and persistence. These events can increase thermal stress and selection pressures on organisms. In February of 2021, winter storm Uri brought an unusually long bout of subfreezing temperatures to the entire state of Texas. As a result of this storm, a total of 2,227 axis deer (Axis axis) mortalities were reported via iNaturalist observations (N = 129) and anecdotally (n = 2098) across seven counties. Of those identified, 63% (35/55) of all mortalities occurred in fawns compared to 21.8% (12/55) in adult females and 14.5% (8/55) in adult males. Three adult females were either pregnant or lactating, and at least two of the adult males were in velvet. Evidence of frostbite was found on males in velvet. We assessed body size and condition of eleven adults (4M:7F) in Kendall, Gillespie and Edwards County to investigate factors that influenced survival during this climatic event. No measurable fat was found on the rump, heart, or kidneys, and rumen contents were primarily grazed forage. Axis deer are a non- native species, endemic to India, that have thrived since their reintroduction to Texas. Axis deer do not have a defined reproductive season, but nearly 80% of fawns are born between January and March, explaining the fawn mortalities observed. We conclude that individuals suffered from increased thermal stress due to exposure, energetic costs of lactation, and heat loss due to immature antlers. We suspect that mortality was much greater than reported. Session D2",oral,NA,2022,NA
45,Repatriation of Illegally Collected Alligator Snapping Turtles into Native Texas Waters,"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is the largest freshwater turtle in North America. As such, M. temminckii are sought after for human consumption and may be vulnerable to overharvest or incidental bycatch. These threats to wild populations have led to the USFWS considering M. temminckii for listing as federally threatened. Despite having protection from harvest in Texas since the 1970’s, M. temminckii are still harvested illegally. In 2016, USWFS agents confiscated 30 alligator snapping turtles from Louisiana poachers that transported wild caught turtles from Texas. Then, in 2020, collaborative efforts between federal and state agencies led to the decision to repatriate these individuals back into native Texas waters. As part of these efforts, genetic analyses and preliminary surveys guided the selection of three release sites in respective river drainages (i.e., Cypress, Neches, and Sabine). To understand how these individuals might respond to repatriation, we attached VHF radios to 23 M. temminckii, and performed weekly post-release telemetry checks. Here we present preliminary results from these ongoing efforts investigating movement patterns, habitat selection, and survival of repatriated M. temminckii.",oral,D2: Amphibians and Reptiles II,2022,NA
46,Investigating the Phylogenetic Relationships of Sirens in Texas,"Sirens in extreme southern Texas are noticeably larger and have subtle morphological differences when compared to more eastern sirens, but the status and taxonomic affinity of these southern populations has been controversial. Some authorities believe these populations are simply large-bodied lesser sirens (Siren intermedia) that experience a prolonged growing season. However, other hypotheses have been proposed, such as the existence of a disjunct population of greater sirens (Siren lacertina), the possibility that southern Texas sirens are a unique taxa (often designated Siren texana), or that more than one species is present in the region. The distinctiveness of this southern population of Siren resulted in Texas Parks and Wildlife Department listing it as “state-threatened” under the taxonomic designation of “South Texas siren - large form”. This vagueness obviously complicates management and conservation of the group. We sequenced multiple mitochondrial fragments from sirens collected from several sites in southern Texas and a population in eastern Texas. We combined our data with publicly available siren sequences to produce phylogenies using a maximum likelihood method. All Texas samples were highly divergent from all out of state samples, except for a Louisiana sequence that closely affiliated itself with our southern Texas samples. Sirens from our eastern Texas site were quite distinct from the southern Texas-Louisiana group. This suggests that at least some populations in Texas are divergent, but the divergence might be better described as a coastal versus inland dichotomy instead of a southern (or Rio Grande Valley) versus eastern dichotomy.",oral,D2: Amphibians and Reptiles II,2022,NA
47,Top Predators Drive Community Structure of Tadpole Assemblages,"Predator-prey interactions affect prey morphology, behavior, and persistence in local habitats, affecting community structure and function. In this study, we explored the effect of top predators on anuran diversity patterns in permanent ponds in Texas. We surveyed larval anuran assemblages across four different top predator regimes including 1) Micropterus salmoides (Largemouth bass, B), 2) Lepomis cyanellus (Green sunfish, G), 3) a combination of both B and G (B+G), and 4) salamander/invertebrate predators (SI). B and G, are considered the dominant top predators in aquatic communities in this region, which affect tadpole communities by feeding directly on tadpoles (i.e. G, SI) or by feeding directly on tadpole predators (i.e. B). Fish sampling was conducted in 2007 using hook and line and dipnetting. and anuran sampling was conducted across two years (2008 -2009), tadpoles and SI sampling was done using dipnetting. In total, 11 species of anuran larvae were collected across 45 ponds. Diversity patterns were calculated using Hill numbers. Ponds where B+G were the maintop predators contained fewest tadpole species (species richness, 0D = 6) compared to B (0D = 10), G (0D = 11), and SI ponds (0D = 11). Common (1D: B=3, G=4, B+G=4, IS=3) and dominant (2D: B=3, G=3, B+G=3, IS=2) species showed a similar number of species between treatments. We show that combined predators have strong effects on species richness and that different top predator identity has different effects on anuran tadpole communities which might be likely mediated through both direct and indirect effects in these communities.",oral,D2: Amphibians and Reptiles II,2022,NA
48,Comparative Calling Phenology of Anurans Across Latitudinal Gradients,"The reproductive phenology of most amphibians is strongly influenced by abiotic factors (temperature and rainfall). Anurans with wide geographic ranges can exhibit latitudinal variation in their reproductive ecology. To explore patterns in latitudinal variation of their timing, intensity, and abiotic correlates of their reproduction, we quantified the calling phenology for five widespread species of anurans - green tree frog (Hyla cinerea), eastern narrow-mouth frog (Gastrophyrne carolinensis), southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus), Blanchard's cricket frog (Acris blanchardi), and gulf coast toad (Incilius nebulifer) - across two sites: 1) the Davey Crockett National Forest/Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest (hereafter East Texas sites), and 2) the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge. Song Meters were deployed in 2015 to passively record for 6 minutes each night (1 min/hr; 2100 h - 0200 h). The number of males calling per species were counted to calculate the average number of males calling per pond per night. Three species were prolonged breeders across both sites, while two were explosive breeders. All five species had longer calling windows in Attwater Prairie Chicken NWR and differed in calling intensity across both sites. Differences in calling windows and intensities could be attributed to habitat type and climatic differences across sites. Emergent vegetation was more widespread at Attwater NWR ponds vs. East TX ponds. Moisture regimes and warm temperatures are important cues affecting the start of anuran breeding seasons. Attwater NWR experiences higher temperatures and greater rainfall, which could explain the longer calling windows of species at this site. Session A3",oral,D2: Amphibians and Reptiles II,2022,NA
49,Influence of Cattle Fever Tick Control Methods on Tick Abundance in White-tailed Deer,"Cattle fever ticks (CFT) were eradicated from most of the U.S. in the 1940s, yet these ticks remain common along the Rio Grande and in Mexico. White-tailed deer can carry CFTs and may be responsible for recent outbreaks in South Texas. To reduce infestations, APHIS and Texas Animal Health Commission maintain hundreds of feeders in a quarantine zone that are baited with corn medicated with Ivermectin. Additionally, cattle within the quarantine zone are regularly treated with injectable antiparasitic drugs. It is hypothesized that treating cattle will remove ticks from the immediate environment, which would benefit local deer. Our objectives for this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of these control efforts on white-tailed deer tick burdens. We captured and collared white-tailed deer in February 2020 and recaptured 13 bucks in November 2020 to adjust collars and assess tick loads. We estimated LoCoH-a home ranges for each buck and calculated percent overlap with treated pastures and number of corn feeders for both the 90% home range and 50% core area. We fit a negative binomial regression model to the data and tested for a relationship between their November tick loads and their relative access to CFT control efforts. We found strong support for a relationship between tick loads and the percent of a deer’s core area encompassed by a pasture under treatment and weaker support for access to feeders in their core area. These results can be used to determine effective treatment efforts to reduce CFTs on white-tailed deer.",oral,A3: Wildlife Disease,2022,NA
50,NA,"White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are a main host for adult black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis), which transmit nearly half of human tick-borne disease agents. We tested a candidate antigen cocktail containing ten tick-salivary proteins that were proven effective in rabbits. Deer were inoculated with two dosages of the antigen cocktail (low dose (100µg) N = 4, high dose (200 µg) N= 4), and a group inoculated with the adjuvant only (control/adjuvant N = 4). Deer were infested with ticks (N = 100 ticks per deer) on three occasions post-inoculation to determine the effects of the antigens on tick feeding and reproductive parameters. There was significant variation amongst treatment groups for weight of replete ticks (P < 0.0001), weight of egg mass (P < 0.0001), bloodmeal conversion to egg mass (P < 0.0001), and percent of larvae that hatched (P < 0.0001). However, no significant variation was detected in vaccinated groups versus the adjuvant-only group. Based on ELISA results deer did develop antibodies to some of the antigens in our candidate cocktail suggesting the methodology was successful and worthy of further endeavors to identify antigenic tick targets. Continued efforts by our group to identify efficacious anti-tick antigens targeting black-legged ticks on white-tailed deer will be discussed. The successful completion of this research will identify key tick-salivary proteins that black-legged ticks utilize to regulate feeding on white-tailed deer and to inform development of a single dose anti-tick vaccine",oral,NA,2022,NA
51,Assessing Genetic Susceptibility of Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) to Prion Diseases Through Prnp Gene Sequencing,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) affects both native and non-native North American Cervids and has become a major conservation issue for wildlife managers worldwide. As CWD continues to expand geographically, concerns about management and species susceptibility continue to be part of a larger narrative of wildlife management, conservation, and human health. Given how CWD is transmitted, and the history of spontaneous generation of novel prion diseases, the possibility of interfamilial transmission also raises concerns. Historically, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) have utilized much of the same habitat as susceptible cervids and occur within the endemic CWD area of Colorado and Wyoming. However, to date, there has been little research on pronghorn susceptibility to prion diseases like CWD. Pronghorn were translocated between 2011-2017 from the Texas Panhandle to the Trans-Pecos region to help offset population declines, where currently both regions contain Texas Parks and Wildlife Department CWD containment and surveillance zones. Our goal is to sequence the prion protein gene, PRNP, exon 3 (the coding region of the prion protein, PrPC) in pronghorn from Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming to compare to amino acid sequences of known susceptible cervids and assess if pronghorn may be susceptible to prion diseases. Currently, we are amplifying and sequencing PRNP from individuals from Texas (including translocated individuals) and New Mexico. This research will be useful for evaluating the potential risks associated with sympatric coexistence of pronghorn with Cervids in CWD containment zones in Texas, and to determine if pronghorn are susceptible to prion diseases.",oral,A3: Wildlife Disease,2022,NA
52,Monitoring White-tailed Deer Border Crossings Relative to Management Efforts for Cattle Fever Ticks Along the USA- Mexico Border,"Ungulates are capable of long-distance movements, a management concern due to the potential to spread disease to livestock and humans. In South Texas, there is growing concern about the increasing presence of the cattle fever tick. This one-host tick can carry a Babesia parasite that is fatal to naïve cattle. The tick and Babesia are endemic in Mexico, and the USDA and TAHC maintain a permanent quarantine zone to prevent re- infestation of the US. Deer serve as alternative hosts for the tick, and may act as long-distance dispersers across the border or the quarantine zone. We studied movements of deer in a high-density population surrounding Falcon Lake, near Zapata, Texas. We captured 100 deer via net gun and helicopter, and deployed GPS collars that collected hourly locations during February 2020-2021. We identified border crossings using time-based GPS tracks and estimated monthly home ranges using local convex hull estimators. Several individuals made long- distance exploratory movements, all remained within the quarantine zone. We observed 98 crossings from 41 deer from Texas to Mexico throughout the year. We are analyzing the placement of crossings and surrounding land metrics that may influence where and when deer cross. Monthly home ranges averaged 63±41 (SE) ha for females and 79±59 (SE) ha for males. Individual deer in this area had small home ranges, but collectively crossed at multiple different locations along the lake shore. Targeting cattle fever tick treatment or other management actions at crossing sites may help decrease the abundance of ticks in the area.",oral,A3: Wildlife Disease,2022,NA
53,Respiratory Microbiomes of Aoudad and Desert Bighorn Sheep in Texas,"Rangewide, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) have experienced die-off events caused by bacterial species referred to as the pneumonia complex. Commonly infected by domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus), transmission may also occur from aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) that coexists with desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) in Texas. Baseline respiratory microbiomes in bighorn sheep and aoudad are poorly known but are important to characterize, to inform diseased state microbiomes if they occur. We performed 16S bacterial sequencing on throat and nasal swabs collected from 278 bighorn sheep and 88 aoudad from 10 mountain ranges in Texas during 2017-2020. Both throat and nasal bacterial community composition was similar between aoudad and bighorn sheep. Perhaps more importantly pneumonia complex bacteria were identified in both respiratory locations in both aoudad and bighorn sheep. Interestingly, microbiome composition at a body site (nasal or throat) was more similar between host species than within species between body sites (nasal compared to throat), suggesting that bighorn sheep and aoudad likely are exchanging multiple bacteria and potential pathogens. Finally, Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae was identified in aoudad throat samples, where the 26 sequences found in aoudad were unique from other published sequences, indicating that aoudad may indeed be a host for pneumonia complex bacteria that are fatal to bighorn sheep. Further work needs to identify, and strain type these Mycoplasma bacteria to more clearly identify how this pathogen may impact bighorn sheep survival and persistence in the Trans Pecos Region.

54,"Influence of Fine-scale Landscape and Vegetation Structure on Bobcat Use of Highway Wildlife Crossings in Cameron County, Texas","Globally, wildlife crossing structures (WCS) are constructed to help improve connectivity of wildlife populations and help reduce wildlife-road mortality. The use of WCSs may be affected by structural characteristics of crossings, human disturbance, and the 3D structure of vegetation in the surrounding landscape. We computed seven metrics of horizontal woody cover structure (percent land cover, patch density, edge density, mean patch area, largest patch index, aggregation index, and Euclidean nearest neighbor distance) from a classified 1-m resolution aerial image in 1-km buffers around 14 wildlife crossing structures in Cameron County and 14 random locations in nearby habitat. We estimated vegetation density at five different heights above the ground from classified light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds within each crossing and random buffer. We then used permutational multivariate analysis of variance to compare the vegetation structure around wildlife crossings to the surrounding landscape. To assess how landscape structure affects wildlife crossing use, we used camera traps to identify bobcat (Lynx rufus) presence at each WCS location. We used a generalized linear mixed model to assess how bobcat detections were related to landscape structure and internal vegetation structure. We expect that landscape structure at WCSs will not differ from the surrounding landscape and bobcat use of WCSs will increase with larger, more connected patches that have higher vegetation density. This study will help determine the effectiveness of WCSs by demonstrating the important landscape and vegetation characteristics that influence use.",oral,B3: Conservation and Ecology of Mammals II,2022,NA
NA,NA,"As of March 1, 2021, the Bureau of Land Management estimated free-roaming feral horse and burro populations exceeding 86,000 on federally managed lands in the West. In May 2018, the New York Times published an article titled, “Let Mountain Lions Eat Horses.” The article implies mountain lions (Puma concolor) either currently do or could limit feral horse (Equus caballus) populations across the western United States. This claim, among others in the article, is not well supported by the existing literature. I will briefly cover the evolution, extinction, and reintroduction of domestic horses to North America, their ecological effects, summarize existing peer-reviewed literature, and the political climate of feral horse management. Based on visits to kill sites from 27 radio-marked mountain lions in the arid ranges of southeastern Nevada, approximately 20% of lion diet consists of feral horses. I will also share these preliminary findings.",oral,NA,2022,NA
55,Response of Ocelots to Paved and Unpaved Roads in Ranchland and Fragmented Systems in Southern Texas,"Identifying how different road surfaces impact wildlife species has increasingly become a topic of conservation concern. Understanding the differences between various road surfaces and their impact on road crossing patterns is key to understanding how endangered ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) may perceive the contrasting landscapes in South Texas. In this study, we used a historic and contemporary telemetry dataset of 71 ocelots (37 males, 34 females) monitored in fragmented areas from 1982 to 2001 and intact ranchlands from 2011 to 2020 to examine the response of ocelots to unpaved and paved roads. We evaluated how within-home range road density varied by road type, as well as biological and study design factors. We further evaluated how these factors influenced road crossing rates within each study area. In fragmented areas, ocelots crossed dirt and gravel roads more often than paved roads and the crossing rate was positively related to road availability among all road types (p < 0.05). Male ocelots in fragmented areas crossed all road types more often than female ocelots, even though males and females did not differ in road availability within home ranges (p > 0.05). However, in the intact ranchlands, ocelots crossed dirt and gravel roads exclusively and the crossing rate was positively related to road availability among road types (p < 0.05). This study provides new insights into how ocelot movements and home ranges are affected by road types, informs recovery efforts on private lands, and road planning efforts to mitigate ocelot-vehicle mortality in the region.",oral,B3: Conservation and Ecology of Mammals II,2022,NA
56,Habitat Partitioning Between Black-backed And Side-striped Jackals in South Africa,"Black-backed jackals (BBJ; Canis mesomelas) and side-striped jackals (SSJ; C. adustus) are widely distributed in southern and east Africa. Range-wide, the distribution of the species overlaps by approximately 26%. In southern Africa, a narrow range distribution overlap zone runs from western Angola to eastern South Africa and southern Mozambique. There is currently little information regarding how these two species partition habitat where they occur sympatrically. We studied jackal activity and habitat use on adjacent reserves located in Limpopo Province, South Africa [Hans Merensky (5,362 ha) and Vygeboom (6,629 ha)]. We deployed 88 camera traps along a two-km × two-km grid network across the study site, each trap consisting of paired infrared game cameras, from mid-December 2019 to mid-February 2020. At each trap site, we collected data on vegetation type and structure. We made 65 observations of BBJ and 159 observations of SSJ across 18 trap sites. Five traps reported BBJ only, seven traps reported SSJ only, and six traps (33%) reported both species. On two occasions, both species were detected at the same trap site during a twenty-four-hour period. This preliminary analysis suggests that BBJ and SSJ may be partitioning habitat spatially and temporally. We will further evaluate spatial use of both species using multi-species occupancy-modeling based on species occurrence and vegetation data. This information will help us better understand the complex interactions between these two species and inform conservation and management decisions, given the dearth of information currently available.

57,Disentangling the Competitive Interactions of Cattle and White-tailed Deer,"Evaluating competition among species is important to understanding food web dynamics, but it is difficult when niche partitioning has already occurred. We used white-tailed deer movement data associated with experimental cattle stocking to disentangle scrabble competition from interference competition among white- tailed deer and cattle. We assumed scramble competition would result from reduced forage quality, and interference competition would occur if antagonistic interactions alter deer behavior. We used home range area as a proxy for habitat quality, assuming deer maintain the smallest home range required for their dietary needs, and velocity and habitat selection as indicators of deer behavior. We predicted habitat quality would not be affected, and home range area would vary with cattle stocking rates. We predicted velocity would decrease with stocking rates, and deer would select areas of denser brush. We deployed GPS-collars on 19 female white-tailed deer across 10 pastures of the San Antonio Viejo Ranch in South Texas and experimentally stocked cattle at rates ranging from 0-15.7 AU/km2 to previously destocked pastures. Using data collected 30 days before and after the stocking event, we estimated home ranges using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models, calculated velocities, and fit step-selection functions. Stocking rates did not influence home range size, however, deer decreased movement velocity (β = -1.42, P = 0.006) and increased selection for brush (β = 0.048, P<0.001) with increasing stocking rates. This indicates cattle may not immediately influence white-tailed deer forage quality, but suggest interference competition between cattle and deer occurred rapidly.",oral,C3: Natural Resources Management,2022,NA
58,Evaluating the Use Of the “Rangeland Analysis Platform” in Large-scale Stocking Rate Decisions in South Texas,"Obtaining reliable estimates of herbaceous biomass on large-scale, heterogenous landscapes can be challenging. Cattle operations use biomass estimates to determine stocking rates and monitor the health of their rangelands. The East Foundation in Jim Hogg County, Texas, manages one of the largest grazing studies in the country and uses herbaceous biomass to make annual adjustments to stocking rates. The current method used for estimating biomass is hand clipping samples spatially stratified by ecological site. Hand clipping grass can be labor intensive and can produce high variability depending on sample size, particularly in large, diverse pastures. A web application called the Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) provides estimates of accumulated herbaceous biomass at 16-day intervals for the western United States. In order to determine if we can supplement or replace clipped samples with RAP data, we clipped 4 frames within the RAP pixel scale (30x30m) every 16 days for 48 days. We clipped 24 pixels (n = 96 frames) across 3 pastures within a rotational treatment in the grazing study. The pixels were distributed evenly within the 2 major ecological types within the pasture (Sandy and Loamy Sand). We will compare clipped samples of biomass against the RAP data by estimating the net growth differences in subsequent clipped samples at 3 spatial scales (pixel, acre, pasture). We will also compare these metrics between the grazed and un-grazed pastures. We hope this information will assist managers with supplementing knowledge of their rangelands and stocking rates with remotely sensed data.",oral,C3: Natural Resources Management,2022,NA
59,The Value of Wildlife Biodiversity: A Review and Empirical Study to Quantify and Monetize Wildlife Biodiversity Benefits of Restoring Native Grassland Plant Communities,"Wildlife biodiversity is essential and valuable for the environment, society, and the economy. Grasslands have long been a biodiversity hotspot before human activity. In Texas, grasslands made up a large portion of the landscape in its historic range. Today, 99% of native grasslands are lost. Human activity has significantly altered these grasslands by conversion to monocultural pastures, agriculture, invasive species introduction, and development. Conversion and degradation of native grasslands decrease biodiversity and decrease ecosystem functioning. Studies have shown how diverse native grassland communities are monetarily valuable through carbon sequestration, water quality, water quantity, erosion control, and flood prevention. Wildlife biodiversity benefits include an array of birds, insects, and bats that disperse seeds and provide pollination services, as well as game species such as quail, deer, and more.Here I introduce a study design comparing wildlife biodiversity between a well-managed, restored native grassland and a poorly-managed, non- native grassland in the Eagle Ford Shale play of south-central Texas. Moreover, I describe a sampling methodology to survey invertebrates and vertebrates, including arthropods, small mammals, reptiles, and birds, to best measure biodiversity. The overall goal of this study is to provide the data necessary to identify the potential monetary, economic value for wildlife biodiversity as a direct benefit from restoring native grassland communities.",oral,C3: Natural Resources Management,2022,NA
60,Determining the Effect of Invasive Vegetation on Small Vertebrate Communities,"Invasive vegetation such as non-native grasses and woody brush species have altered many South Texas rangelands that were once native mixed grass and tallgrass prairie ecosystems. The objectives of this study are to determine how non-native and invasive dominated habitats differ from intermediately invaded and native habitats in composition and habitat structure and determine how small vertebrate species differ in abundance, diversity, and composition across this habitat gradient. We sampled several sites at the Welder Wildlife Refuge to identify community and habitat differences along this gradient of ecosystem change (i.e., native, moderately invaded, invaded). Over the course of two years, we captured 853 unique individual small mammals and 2192 herpetofauna representing 8 and 37 species, respectively. Small mammal diversity was lowest in native habitats but there were no significant differences in herpetofaunal diversity. Species composition did differ between habitat types, with invaded sites consisting mainly of generalist species and native sites hosting more habitat specialists, suggesting that the effects of habitat change on small vertebrates is seen at the species level.",oral,C3: Natural Resources Management,2022,NA
61,A Monitoring Program to Evaluate the Coastal Grassland Restoration Incentive Program,"The Gulf Coast Joint Venture (GCJV) is a regionally based, biologically driven, landscape-oriented volunteer partnership of private, state, and federal conservation organizations dedicated to the delivery of habitat important to priority bird species. The GCJV partnership’s Coastal Grassland Restoration Incentive Program (C- GRIP) provides financial incentives to private landowners for conducting habitat treatments that address the greatest limiting factor(s) to provide suitable grassland bird habitat on their property. The C-GRIP program is a way for the GCJV to deliver bird habitat to meet planning objectives for grassland birds. Our monitoring objective is to evaluate whether or not the C-GRIP program is effective in providing a relative increase in the density (number/acre) of priority grassland bird species over a 10-year period in focal delivery areas versus control areas over a 10-year period. Twenty survey routes (2 within each of 5 focal areas and 2 outside of each area, serving as controls), located on secondary and tertiary roads were designated in the Texas Mid-Coast Initiative Area of the GCJV. Each route measures 24.5 miles in length and the land cover is similar along all survey routes. Each route has ≥30 point-count stations separated by ≥0.5 mile. We recognize that some routes will experience increased development over time, especially in counties neighboring large population centers such as Houston and Victoria. The plan is to continue to monitor these routes, as long as safety concerns do not increase. Our paper will include determining the monitoring objective, survey route selection, and survey methodology.",oral,C3: Natural Resources Management,2022,NA
62,Can Cropping Rate Variability Reduce the Costs of Antipredator and Social Vigilance?,"Mammalian herbivores spend substantial portions of each day foraging to consume large quantities of nutrient-poor food. Vigilance is a behavior that interrupts foraging and is used by prey species to identify and avoid predators. Despite its antipredator benefits, vigilance imposes a foraging cost: increased time spent vigilant reduces time available to forage. We investigated the possibility that ungulates vary their cropping rate while foraging to increase forage intake and compensate for vigilance costs. We posed the questions: Is cropping rate constant across varying levels of vigilance? If not, what factors drive its variability? To answer these questions, we compared the proportion of time elk spent vigilant (HU) to their cropping rate using data collected from 199 observations of elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti) in Redwood National and State Parks from 2015 to 2016. If cropping rate was constant, a regression of the data would have an absolute value of the slope equal to the y- intercept. We fit a linear mixed-effect model to the data, and the y-intercept was 24.68 bites, minute-1 and the slope was -49.90 bites . minute-1 demonstrating that the slope value differed from the y-intercept value. Additionally, cropping rate was influenced by factors other than HU including length of the focal observation, time of day, and proportion of the foraging bout spent in close proximity to a conspecific. These two findings establish our study as the first to confirm that cropping rate is not constant, and therefore the costs of vigilance can be mitigated in certain circumstances.

63,Effects of Prescribed Burning on Butterfly Populations in Coastal South Texas,"Virtually all the world’s seed plants need to be pollinated, and this is most often done via pollinators. Approximately 76% of flowering plants rely on insects for pollination, making insect pollinators such as butterflies or bees vital in any ecosystem. With this knowledge, land managers should look to improve pollinator habitat in their management areas. A method for managing rangeland plants is the use of prescribed fire. Fire can act as a useful tool to reduce dead plant matter and promote new, highly nutritious plant growth. Our objective is to determine effects of varying prescribed burn intervals and seasons on butterfly populations in coastal South Texas. The study site is a private ranch in Willacy and Kenedy Counties, Texas, in the Coastal Marsh and Prairies ecoregion. Plots ranging from 200 to 485 ha (500 to 1200 ac) are treated with either: summer or winter long return intervals, summer or winter short return intervals, or no-burning (control). Beginning in March 2020 monthly butterfly and vegetation surveys were conducted to determine effects of season of burn, return interval, and time since burning on butterfly communities. Early analyses show evidence of fire return interval having an effect on butterfly family richness. These results will help land managers determine optimal burn season and return interval for maximizing butterfly populations.",oral,D3: Fire Ecology and Management,2022,NA
64,NA,"Fire is an effective tool for managing white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) habitat, affecting browse availability, herbaceous forage production, and nutrient availability. This study utilized 46 plots, plots were located within the Winston 8 Ranch, Nature Conservancy’s Roy E. Larsen Sandylands Sanctuary, Davy Crocket National Forest, Angelina National Forest, and the Sabine National Forest, to assess browse production, utilization, and nutrient availability. Fixed radius (0.2 ha) plots and a modified version of Texas parks and Wildlife (TPWD) stem count index survey method, measured prior to green up, were utilized. Nutrient sampling occurred before green up and any prescribed burns. Preferred browse species were clipped and analyzed for nutrient quality. Forage production was measured during the growing season using a PVC rectangular frame (0.3 meter by 0.6 meter by 1.5 meter) located adjacent to the above plots. The frame base (0.3 meter by 0.6 meter) was used as a Daubenmire frame and all herbaceous material was clipped by species, oven dried, and weighed to nearest 0.01 grams. All new woody plant foliar growth within the frame was also clipped by species, oven dried, and weighed. Preliminary results on the Winston 8 Ranch and Sandylands Sanctuary suggested that % crude protein levels were highest under frequent burn rotations(P<0.05), in agreement with past studies.",oral,NA,2022,NA
65,Fire and Mice: The Effects of Prescribed Burns on Rodent Communities,"Prescribed burns are becoming an increasingly popular method for managing rangelands for livestock. In areas like the coastal sand plains ecoregion of Texas, prescribed burns can be effective in removing mature gulf cordgrass (Spartina spartinae) and promoting regrowth of vegetation that provides greater nutritional value for livestock. While the long-term benefits of these burns for large herbivores have been shown, the effects on small mammals that use this vegetation for food and shelter, are largely understudied. Small mammal species - in this case, mouse and rat species - can be used as indicators for ecosystem recovery and overall biodiversity of an area. To understand the response and recovery of these species to prescribed burns, a long-term monitoring study is currently being conducted on the East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch. Based on 3 years of data collection following controlled burns, within 60 days of being burned, the number of small mammals captured ~28% of that of non-burned areas that same year. One year post-burn, that recovery is about 75% and 2 years post-burn the number of animals captured reaches 141% of that of the non-burned areas. These findings suggest that small mammal communities recover from prescribed burns within 2-3 years. As we continue this study our goals are to make recommendations towards prescribed burn scheduling that can benefit both the livestock and the wildlife of an area.",oral,D3: Fire Ecology and Management,2022,NA
66,Effects of Prescribed Fire on White-tailed Hawk Nesting Locations at El Sauz Ranch,"While the white-tailed hawk (Geranoaetus albicaudatus) is a prevalent raptor throughout its range in Central and South America, it is listed as state-threatened in Texas. The northernmost extent of its range is coastal Texas and only one of the three subspecies, G. a. hypospodius, resides in that region. In 2021 we initiated efforts to investigate the breeding ecology of the white-tailed hawk on the East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch, which is over 10,000 ha and located in Port Mansfield, TX. We found 14 active and historical nests on the property throughout the 2021 breeding season. Gulf cordgrass (Spartina spartinae) is a native, perennial bunchgrass found throughout the gulf coast of Texas, but the mature growth must be removed to increase nutritional value and enable its use as forage for cattle. Fire is an effective tool to make this possible so the East Foundation conducts prescribed burns in different seasons on the property to stimulate regrowth that is palatable for livestock. Since burning is frequently used as a management tool in south Texas, it is important to understand how its use affects native wildlife species, especially species of concern. Using the information from winter burns, summer burns, and control plots with the 14 known nest locations found on the property, I will present the patterns of these burns as potential effects on white-tailed hawk nest site selection.",oral,D3: Fire Ecology and Management,2022,NA

Estimating Breeding Values for Antler Size in Male White-tailed Deer","Selective harvest has the potential to affect population genetics in species with luxury phenotypic traits (e.g., antlers). Some managers actively practice culling, or selective harvest of individuals with low-quality phenotypes, in an attempt to improve population genetic potential for luxury traits. Others have voiced concern about high-grading, where harvesting the best animals allows low-quality individuals to breed, which may lead to a decrease in trait values. The management of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is tightly intertwined within this debate. The potential for selective harvest to affect population genetic potential for a trait depends on the correlation between phenotypes and genotypes. Our goal was to investigate the relationship between a sire’s antler phenotype and that of his male offspring. We analyzed a long-term data set from an ongoing research project that has followed several generations of wild deer and their sons. Eighteen bucks sired 329 buck fawns during temporary confinement in deer management permit (DMP) experimental pens during 2007-2020. Fawns were captured and ear-tagged, then released into a 400-ha game-fenced enclosure. Each autumn, we captured tagged bucks using helicopter net-gunning and recorded antler scores according to the Boone & Crockett system. We calculated the breeding value for each sire as the difference between the average antler score of his sons at >=5.5 years old relative to the population average for that age class. We found a weak relationship (R2 = 0.26) between the antler scores of sires and their breeding value. Our results have important implications for selective harvest plans.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
115,Assessing Mammal Diversity in Cross Timbers and Post Oak Savannah Ecoregions,"Mammals are an important part of ecosystems. Presence and abundance of mammal communities can be indicators of habitat quality or structure, community structure and species richness. Mammal diversity on Texas Military Department properties in the Cross Timbers and Post Oak savannah ecoregions is understudied. Our objectives were to quantify the species richness of and community structure of mammals and we hypothesized diversity will provide insights on habitat quality in each study area. Since early 2020, we have conducted camera surveys on Camp Swift Army Base in the Post Oak Savannah Ecoregion and the Camp Bowie Training Center in the Cross Timbers ecoregion. Camera-traps were distributed in a hexagon grid with four stations (of two cameras) per average home range of Rio Grande wild turkeys (12 km^2) for a concurrent study. Camera trap detection events will be sorted to the species-level, and we will use this information to develop diversity distribution surface models. Further, we will use activity data from camera trap detections to assess trophic level interactions between species. This study will provide valuable information on mammal community dynamics in each eco-region.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
102,Can Light to Moderate Cattle Grazing Stocking Rates Improve Bobwhite Habitat?,"Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have been affected by dense stands of undisturbed grasses that result in low plant diversity and limited bare ground. Bobwhites require a diverse plant composition and arrangement of woody, herbaceous and bare ground cover for nesting, brooding, feeding, resting, and roosting. Cattle grazing reduces aboveground biomass and in return creates a patch mosaic vegetation structure of different plant successional stages. The objective of this research is to assess habitat for bobwhites under a grazing regime that is flexible with stocking rates to maintain proper stubble height. We will monitor forage height and cattle will be removed to maintain an optimal bunchgrass stubble height of 25 cm for bobwhite nesting. We will deploy 15 GPS collars on cows to follow cattle herd movements and distribution within the pasture. We will deploy ~75 telemetry collars on bobwhites to estimate covey home range. We will use unmanned aerial vehicle imagery from 6 flights to assess vegetation structure and spatial heterogeneity within the pasture. We will focus on the spatial arrangement of the vegetation at the pasture scale, evaluating the abundance of bobwhite under the effects of a proper grazing regime. We will be able to answer if cattle grazing distribution is spread evenly across the pasture, and if quail follow cattle herd movements along the pasture as grazing continues. This will help land managers with the basis to create the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in vegetation structure needed to improve bobwhite habitat while maintaining income from livestock.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
85,Diet Preferences of Captive Plateau and Tamaulipan Spot-tailed Earless Lizards,"Conservation knowledge about rare species is difficult because of the lack of information about their ecology and natural history. The lack of information creates difficulties in assessing the status of a species. This is the case with spot-tailed earless lizards (STEL; Holbrookia lacerata (Plateau) and H. subcaudalis (Tamaulipan)), which are currently being considered for federal threatened status. Because STEL are in the Family Phrynosomatidae, it has been assumed that they would have a similar diet as their cousin, the Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum). We tested this hypothesis by capturing 12 Plateau and 13 Tamaulipan STEL from San Angelo and Bishop, Texas, respectively, and housed them individually in 38-l aquaria. We provided each lizard with a self-feeder, cafeteria-style choice of 5 crickets (Family Gryllidae), 5 termites (Family Termitoidae), 5 harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex spp.), 5 flightless fruit flies (Drosophilia melanogaster), and 5 dubia roaches (Blaptica dubia) and monitored their daily consumption during a 5-day period. We calculated the area under the consumption curve for each diet item to determine diet preference. No difference in diet selection was observed (P >0.95) between species of STEL; however, a treatment*day interaction occurred (P < 0.0001). STEL overwhelmingly selected for crickets and avoided harvester ants. Termites were second choice, followed equally by flies and roaches. Although STEL and Texas horned lizards have overlapping distributional ranges, the two species avoid competition by selecting different diets. Experimental Infestations of White-tailed Deer with Ticks to Study Tick Feeding and Reproductive Parameters Alec Baker, Texas A&M, College Station, TX, USA Tammi Johnson, Texas A&M AgriLife Research, Uvalde, TX, USA Albert Mulenga, Texas A&M, College Station, TX, USA Pia Olafson, United States Department of Agriculture, Kerrville, TX, USA Abstract: White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are a main host for black-legged (Ixodes scapularis) and Lone Star ticks (Amblyomma americanum). The population increase of white-tailed deer in the twentieth century has correlated with the rise of various tick-borne pathogens that are known to be spread by black-legged, Lone Star, and other species of ticks. To determine tick feeding and reproductive parameters when fed on white-tailed deer we experimentally infested white-tailed deer (N = 6) with black-legged ticks (N = 50 mated pairs of ticks per deer) and will experimentally infest deer (N=5) with Lone Star ticks (N = 50 mated pairs of ticks per deer). One day prior to tick infestations, an area on the back of the deer was shaved and a six-inch cotton stockinette was glued to the area using TORBOT bonding cement. Tick feeding was restricted to the area at the base of the neck and between the shoulders to reduce the probability of the stockinette/ticks being groomed off by the deer. Once infested with ticks, we monitored tick feeding daily; detached fed ticks were removed from the patch, individually weighed, placed in a glass dram, and held in a humidity-controlled incubator. Ticks were monitored daily to quantify baseline feeding and reproductive parameter. The results of this research will help inform future research targeting white-tailed deer for tick control. The methods from this research can also be used to study the interaction of other tick and arthropod species that utilize white-tailed deer as a bloodmeal source.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
72,Avian Diversity at the Urban-wildland Interface in South Texas,"Webb County is a rapidly developing region of south Texas, with increasing urban expansion into the surrounding Tamaulipan thornscrub habitat. This urbanization has implications for the overall biodiversity of the region. Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) is a microcosm of this phenomenon, as it contains an urban campus and an undeveloped Tamaulipan thornscrub habitat of similar area. The objective of this study is to compare the avian species richness and avian diversity between the TAMIU campus and TAMIU bike trails. We hypothesize that the trails will be more diverse due to the exclusivity of scrub habitat species, as compared to generalist urban birds that may overlap between campus and the trails. We conducted point count surveys along the perimeter of the TAMIU campus and the TAMIU bike trails during the spring and fall migration seasons in 2021. We surveyed 10 points for 5 minutes each and recorded the number and the species of birds seen and heard within the allotted time. The total species richness was 90, with 78 species occurring at the campus and 66 species at the trails. We found a statistically significant difference in Shannon’s diversity between the campus and trails during the fall, but not during the spring survey season. During the fall season we found that Shannon’s diversity was higher at the trails than it was for the campus sites. This study will provide insight into the effects of urbanization on the local avian biodiversity and help guide local land management.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
94,Soil Seed Bank Composition in a Native and a Restored Tallgrass Prairie at Multiple Depths,"The soil seed bank plays an important role in restoration by contributing both desirable and undesirable species and has even been found to contain higher diversity than aboveground vegetation. However, most research into seed bank composition is at only shallow depths (common maximum depth is 20 cm). We collected soil samples on a retired farm 2 years after being seeded with tallgrass prairie species in Fannin County, Texas; soil samples were also collected at a nearby undisturbed tallgrass prairie, Tridens Prairie. At the restoration site, soil samples were collected at a depth classified by the NRCS to be below the anthropogenic layer, ranging from 10-68 cm. In sites where the anthropogenic layer was shallower than plow disturbance (~30 cm), a second sample was collected below the plow layer. At Tridens Prairie, samples were collected below the plow layer and at the deepest depth from the restoration site. We compared species composition across sites and depths to determine if a native seed bank was present under the plow layer in hopes that, under suitable conditions, these seeds would be able to germinate and therefore further restoration efforts. An Assessment of Small Mammal Diversity, Population Demography, Occupancy, and Damage Among Three Irrigation Systems in Row Crops on The Southern High Plains Annie Braack, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, United States Blake Grisham, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Abstract: The Southern High Plains (SHP) is among the most agricultural intensive landscapes in the world. The region is directly above the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides water for irrigation for row crops that normally would not grow in the semi-arid region. Irrigation options for producers on the SHP range among above-ground systems (e.g., center pivot), underground systems (e.g., subsurface drip irrigation), no irrigation (i.e., dry land), or combination of irrigation methods. The recent addition of subsurface irrigation systems has numerous advantages for producers and water sustainability, yet little to no information exists pertaining to if small mammal populations benefit from, or cause damage to, irrigation systems on the SHP. The goal of our study was to quantify if small mammal population demographics and if small mammal damage to irrigation infrastructure differed among three experimental treatments: 1) dryland (control), 2) subsurface drip irrigation, and 3) center pivot irrigation. We conducted a mark-recapture (population demographics) and camera-trap (damage) field study on 18 unique cropland sites (hereafter “fields”) to assess occupancy, abundance, survival, and recapture probabilities, May - August 2021. We captured small mammals using Sherman Live Traps for 9 days within each season and each field, respectively. Our preliminary results suggested small mammal abundance was higher in both types of irrigated fields compared to the control. Camera trap data is preliminary, but data from the first field season suggests small mammals chose gnawing materials at random, and damage may not be related to their need to gnaw, but rather obtain access to water.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
143,Multi-scale Habitat Selection of Breeding Female Northern Pintails in The Prairie Pothole Region,"The northern pintail (Anas acuta) is a species of dabbling duck that has experienced population declines in the last 4 decades of which a strong association to nesting in croplands throughout the Prairie Pothole Region is considered a key causal effect. This nesting behavior exposes pintail to higher rates of nest destruction by spring crop cultivation and predators. Our objectives are to 1) investigate habitat selection by northern pintails within the Prairie Pothole Region at multiple spatial scales and 2) estimate breeding effort (e.g., number of eggs laid, nesting attempts) and nesting success as a function of habitat characteristics. We began data collection in January 2020 and will continue into 2022. We deployed GSM-GPS tracking devices on females during winter which is expected to reduce bias in subsequent breeding habitat selection. Device deployment occurred on multiple wintering areas including the Louisiana coast, Texas coast, Texas Panhandle, Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico, Southwestern Arizona, and the Central Valley of California. To date we have 47,278 non- flight locations from 71 individuals within the Prairie Pothole Region. Average arrival date to the Prairie Pothole Region was March 31st and the average nest initiation date was May 18th. We will use a multi-scale Resource Selection Function (RSF) to evaluate habitat selection by nesting pintails. The results of this project will improve our knowledge about habitat use by northern pintails on breeding areas and provide information for future management strategies.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
71,Carnivore Community Interactions in a Brush Managed Landscape,"Carnivore community interactions are driven by predation, competition, and vegetation structure on the landscape. Habitat management strategies can alter resource availability and carnivore distribution on the landscape. South Texas rangelands are heavily managed for brush plant communities through clearing and brush sculpting. This has proven beneficial to native economically valued prey species (e,g., upland game birds and ungulates). However, brush management impacts on native carnivores such as bobcats (Lynx rufus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and raccoons (Procyon lotor) remain understudied. Since March 2021 we have conducted camera surveys (54 cameras) on the Hixon Ranch, La Salle County, Texas to examine spatial and temporal interactions of these three carnivore species in brush managed management areas. We conducted a preliminary diel overlap activity analysis, indicating that bobcats and coyotes do not exhibit significantly different circadian rhythms (w=1.25, p > 0.05), but raccoon differed from both carnivores (w=7.36, p < 0.05, w= 4.03, p < 0.05). Future analyses include multispecies occupancy modeling to examine behavioral interactions and find environmental drivers of carnivore co-occurrence in the landscape. These analyses will help further the understanding of carnivore community ecology in these managed areas. Determining Wildlife Crossing Structure Performance Compared to Wildlife Movement Through Surrounding Habitat Caitlin K. Brett, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA John H. Young, Texas Department of Transportation, Austin, TX, USA Richard J. Kline, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA Abstract: Wildlife crossing structures (WCS) are often paired with roadside exclusion fencing to mitigate direct (e.g., wildlife-vehicle collisions) and indirect (e.g., constrained movement, habitat fragmentation) effects of roadways on wildlife. These structures may be used differently and at different rates by various taxa, so it is important to assess whether they are accomplishing mitigation goals across the wildlife community. Many studies document WCS usage by local wildlife but fail to compare this to wildlife use of the adjacent habitat which WCS are intended to connect. This can lead to premature conclusions about the relative success of these structures and their designs.Eight WCS were installed on Farm-to-Market Road 106 in Cameron County, TX to mitigate ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) road mortalities and to reduce the potential barrier effect of the road for all species. We collected camera trap data on actual WCS use and expected use based on habitat reference sites throughout the study corridor. Reference site and WCS data was then compared for select target species to determine performance differentials (PD) for each WCS. Positive PD indicate that a WCS is used more often than comparable surrounding habitat; negative PD indicate that a WCS is used less often than comparable habitat. WCS design factors were then tested to determine their influence on WCS performance differentials, including openness ratio, availability of woody canopy cover, and length of adjacent exclusion fencing. Determining the influence of these factors may help inform future WCS designs to ensure they meet mitigation goals. Body Condition and Relative Abundance of Four Turtle Species Across a Gradient of Ecological Integrity Tristan Brownjohn, Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX, USA David Rosenbaum, Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX, USA Christopher Schalk, Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX, USA Abstract: Understanding how species respond to land-use changes is vital to predict population trends. Turtles are model taxa to explore questions related to species responses to land-use changes, because they are long-lived ectotherms that are ubiquitous across freshwater ecosystems. Using survey data from 51 sites across eastern Texas, we quantified variation in body condition (BCI) and catch per unit effort (CPUE) across a gradient of ecological integrity for four turtle species: red-eared Slider (Trachemys scripta), razorback musk turtle (Sternotherus carinatus), alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminickii), and spiny softshell (Apalone spinifera). We quantified ecological integrity of each site’s land cover using the NatureServe Land Condition Model (LCM). Due to broad habitat niche breadth of these focal species, we predicted that there would be no variation in BCI or CPUE across the land cover gradient. Trachemys scripta exhibited higher CPUE at sites with lower ecological integrity, but we observed the opposite trend for its BCI. Sternotherus carinatus BCI increased with increasing values of the LCM, and it occurred in a narrow range of high-integrity sites, but we observed no pattern with its CPUE. CPUE decreased and BCI increased with increasing ecological integrity for both M. temminckii and A. spinifera. Macrochelys temminckii occurred in sites spanning the widest range of the land cover gradient. Trachemys scripta’s higher abundance at sites with lower ecological integrity corroborates its ability to utilize urbanized habitat. The occurrence of S. carinatus across a narrow range of sites may indicate it has specific habitat requirements not met in lower-integrity sites.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
98,Latency to Initial Detection for Mammalian Species in a Mixed Hardwood-pine Forest,"Mammals can exhibit a wide array of detection probabilities which can be used in the determination of population size in an area as well as habitat use by the species observed. Latency to initial detection (LTD) is defined as the amount of time to initial detection of a species at a given site. LTD is an important metric to understand the amount of effort needed to detect a species, which in turn, is important in estimating their population size. We sought to quantify the LTD for mammals in the SFA Experimental Forest in October 2021. Twenty-two trail cameras were installed at intervals of 200 meters in the Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest for 19 days equating to 418 trap nights. Cameras were programmed to take bursts of 5 photographs upon detection of motion with no delay between motion triggers. Species observed include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), feral hog (Sus scrofa), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), coyote (Canis latrans), eastern gray/fox squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis/niger), and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana). Initial detection of each mammal species was recorded for each camera to show movement across sites and summarized to articulate LTD for the species listed. Larger population sizes as well as frequency and distribution of habitat use could explain the earlier initial detection of white-tailed deer and nine-banded armadillo across camera sites. Recent disturbances in the areas surveyed likely also play a role in the delayed or lack of detection of species such as racoon, opossum, and squirrels.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
90,Distribution and Co-occurrence of Carnivores in Big Bend National Park,"Carnivores are essential for the structure and function of ecosystems as they have a significant impact on lower trophic levels. Carnivore communities are shaped by habitat and resource availability as well as species interactions, such as intraguild predation and competition. Big Bend National Park is inhabited by 14 carnivore species that include large carnivores and mesocarnivores. Large carnivores include mountain lions (Puma concolor) and black bears (Ursus americanus). Mesocarnivores include bobcats (Lynx rufus), badgers (Taxidea taxis), coyotes (Canis latrans), kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), ringtails (Bascarisscus astutus), long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata), hooded skunks (Mephitis macroura), hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus lecontei), spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). To better understand these species interactions, cameras were placed within and surrounding the Chisos Mountains to monitor detections and further determine habitat characteristics that could influence a species presence, such as human impact, habitat type, tree canopy cover, elevation, and slope. To produce image recognition data, MegaDetector was used on all photos, as well as Timelapse2 to identify and label species. Approximately 1 million photos were collected from 58 camera trap locations within the study area between 2014 to 2019. Our study summarizes the distribution, habitat characteristics, and co-occurrence of carnivores in BBNP.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
126,Comparison of Night and Day Road Mortality Detections in South Texas,"Road mortality surveys serve as an important tool for ecologists to evaluate the effectiveness of road mitigation structures and monitor wildlife road mortalities. The accuracy of road mortality surveys can be inconsistent and may underestimate counts for small vertebrates due to factors such as low carcass persistence and low detectability. Conducting road mortality surveys at night instead of daytime could increase detections by documenting mortalities before the carcass is removed or degraded. In this study, data collection consisted of paired night and day mortality surveys over fifteen weeks on two roads in Cameron County, Texas. Analysis consisted of comparisons of the day and night survey by taxon and by the overall community observed. Results indicated detections of some small vertebrate taxa, especially amphibians, were higher during night surveys. This research could help serve as an assessment of carcass removal rates and how it can be accounted for in road mortality modeling.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
135,Can Remote Cameras be Used to Access Tick Loads on Nilgai Antelope,"Nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are a free-ranging exotic species in South Texas that are a suitable host of cattle fever ticks. Cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and R. (B.) annulatus) are a major concern for wildlife and livestock stakeholders. Nilgai have large home range sizes and have the potential to disperse ticks from infested areas. Nilgai prefer to cross under livestock fences rather than jump, and it is important to monitor their movements to neighboring properties. The use of technology, including remote game cameras, to monitor wildlife has become an important tool in wildlife management. The goal of this study was to determine if remote cameras can be used as a tool to assess tick loads on nilgai. Between February 2019 and September 2020, we captured 140 nilgai during 5 capture events held on 3 private ranches located in Cameron County, Texas. We collected ticks from all captured individuals. We also monitored 140 fence crossing sites with remote cameras during this period. We evaluated photos based on how many vital areas were clearly visible and whether ticks were present. We compared prevalence rates of ticks on captured nilgai to camera data. We found ticks (≥ 1) on 83-98% of captured individuals. Using cameras may have limitations such as poor image quality, inability to capture vital areas, and seasonal variations in tick numbers. However, capturing wildlife is not always an option, so use of remote cameras to monitor wildlife health could prove to be a useful tool.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
108,Nesting Success of Scissor-tailed Flycatchers in Rural Vs. Urban Habitats,"For avian species, nest site selection can influence their reproductive success through many factors such as predation, shelter from weather, and accessibility of food. Scissor-tailed flycatchers (Tyrannus forficatus) nest in urban and rural areas and there is little information on how these different habitats influence their reproductive success. Our objectives are to compare nest survival between urban and rural locations, identify nest site characteristics associated with survival in both locations, and identify the predator assemblages. We will locate and monitor nests in Stephenville, Texas and at rural locations in the surrounding area from March- August 2022. We will place cameras at a selected subset of nests to identify predators. Upon completion of the nest, we will collect vegetation measurements that we hypothesize are characteristic of suburban vs rural areas and those measurements that might influence detection of the nest by predators. This study will contribute to our understanding of the specific habitat needs and resources that influence reproductive success of scissor-tailed flycatchers. Characterization Of Black-capped Vireo Habitat at Government Canyon State Natural Area, San Antonio, Texas Clifton Cooper, Trinity University, San Antonio, TX, USA Thomas Bates, Trinity University, San Antonio, TX, USA Brittany L. Slabach, Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas, United States Abstract: The Black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) is a migratory songbird found in portions of the south- central United States and Mexico. This species is considered conservation reliant because it prefers to nest in early-successional shrubland habitats. The species was delisted from the Endangered Species List in 2018, but it remains a species of concern in Texas and is considered vulnerable due to its restricted range and required nesting habitat. In 2021, 74 BCVI males were detected on a 186-hectare parcel at Government Canyon State Natural Area, San Antonio, TX. In 2003, a planned housing development resulted in the removal of 35% of woody vegetation cover on this parcel, and vegetation has subsequently recovered to a successional stage that BCVI prefers. We are working to characterize vegetation structure to ensure the conservation of Black-capped vireos on this site. We sampled a total of 112 points, conducting 448 vegetation transects across a 38.5-hectare area. The most prevalent species found were Juniper (Juniperus ashei), Oak (Quercus spp.), and Texas mountain laurel (Dermatophyllum secundiflorum). Vegetation below three meters averaged 1.91m (SD = 0.47), whereas the bottom height averaged 0.5m (SD = 0.41). Distance to the nearest vegetation was 2.88m (SD = 4.25). This field data is being used alongside remote sensing data (e.g., NDVI and LiDAR) to compare changes in vegetation structure across a twenty-year period to better predict the effect of habitat changes on the presence of Black- capped vireos. Grazing Pressure Bison Have on Arthropods and Vegetation Community at Caprock Canyons State Park, Texas Ty C. Cosper, Tarleton State University, Stephenville, TX, USA Heather Mathewson, Tarleton State University, Stephenville, TX, USA Molly Koeck, Tarleton State University, Stephenville, TX, USA Donald Beard, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Caprock Canyons State Park, TX, USA Adam Mitchell, Tarleton State University, Stephenville, TX, USA Abstract: In 1997, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) relocated 36 southern plains bison (Bison bison bison) to Caprock Canyon State Park (CCSP), a 6,070-ha state park in Briscoe County, Texas, USA. There are now over 250 bison in the park and to manage the herd and the park, TPWD is interested in knowing about grazing pressure on the land. The objective of this study is to determine what effect the bison have on the vegetation and arthropod community in the park. In summer 2018, TPWD established 18 3-m2 fenced areas to create grazing-exclusion plots. In Spring 2020, we started monthly surveys of the plant and arthropod community in grazed areas and grazing exclosures. We randomly place 2 Daubenmire frames in the grazing exclosure area and 2 frames 30 m away in a random direction to represent areas available for grazing. For each Daubenmire frame we estimate bare ground, litter, plant diversity, and height. We collected ground-dwelling arthropods using one pitfall trap (0.27 L cup) inside and 30 m away from the exclusion plot. We also collect insect pollinators using a bee pan trap (0.53 L cup) colored fluorescent yellow, white, or blue; we randomly select the color of the bee pan trap inside each exclusion plot and the corresponding 30 m away for every survey. We hope to provide insight on how CCSP can promote coexistence for plant and arthropod communities in areas grazed by bison. Nest Site Selection and Nest Survival of Avian Communities in Pinyon-juniper Woodlands Undergoing Thinning Prescriptions Tucker Davidson, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Clint Boal, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Corrie Borgman, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States Abstract: Pinyon-juniper woodlands are among the most diverse and widespread ecological communities in the western United States and provide habitat for a rich diversity of avian species. More than a century of livestock grazing and fire suppression, along with other issues, has resulted in the expansion of pinyon-juniper woodlands into arid and semi-arid grasslands across the Southwest. On the Fort Stanton-Snowy River National Conservation Area in Lincoln County, New Mexico, land managers are using mechanical thinning and prescribed fire to reduce fuel loads, increase forage availability for game species, and return pinyon-juniper woodlands to historic distributions and structure. However, the high proportion of avian pinyon-juniper specialists listed on national and state species of concern lists has created a need to balance thinning targets with conservation of these bird species. Our investigation centers on how these forest management practices influence nest-site selection, nest survival, and productivity of the breeding bird communities. Since 2019, we have found, monitored, and documented over 700 nesting attempts of 30+ species within approximately 1,000 hectares on the Fort Stanton NCA. Data processing and analysis are ongoing, and preliminary results from our research have yielded nest survival rates and basic habitat associations with nest-sites for multiple specialist bird species. Our final results will provide valuable insight into population trends of pinyon-juniper obligate and semi-obligate bird species in south-central New Mexico and provide pertinent feedback for land managers aiming to provide high- quality nesting habitat for the avian community while balancing other management needs.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
100,Coyote Population Dynamics and Food Habits in the Mojave Desert Region,"Since the mid-1900s, coyotes (Canis latrans) have expanded their geographic range throughout North America, due in part to anthropogenic influences. Human subsidized food resources and man-made green spaces have brought coyotes into the urban interface, creating more human-coyote conflicts. The Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) in Twentynine Palms, California has substantial residential zones, and densely populated barracks, where human-coyote conflicts regularly occur. Beyond these human-coyote issues, MCAGCC is also intensely involved with the management and recovery of the threatened, Agassiz’s desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), an iconic species of the Mojave Desert. In this drought susceptible region, mammalian predators frequently resort to secondary food items. Tortoise depredation by canids, most likely coyotes, continues to present wildlife-wildlife conflicts, but very few diet analyses have quantified the frequency of tortoise parts in coyote diets. Similarly, no reliable coyote population estimates exist for MCAGCC, but these estimates are crucial for developing management actions for tortoises and coyotes. In 2021, we collected > 2500 canid scat samples at MCAGCC for use in non-invasive DNA sampling to (a) develop spatially explicit mark- recapture population models using mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene amplification, and (b) analyze food habits, using traditional and molecular techniques. This research will inform us of coyote population size and connectivity, as well as their impacts upon tortoises - both of which will be useful for human and coyote management at and outside of MCAGCC. Effect of Estimated Fecal Age and Sample Storage Techniques on Coyote DNA Amplification in The Mojave Desert Region Andrew T. Dotray, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Danielle C. Deming, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Brian T. Henen, Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, CA, USA Robert D. Bradley, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Emily A. Wright, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Warren C. Conway, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Abstract: Coyote (Canis latrans) ecology is poorly understood in portions of the Mojave Desert, where they coexist and prey upon the threatened Agassiz’s desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii). In the Twentynine Palms region of the Mojave Desert, coyote population size, connectivity, and dynamics are poorly known, but are important relative to their potential impact on desert tortoise recovery in the region. With the advent of non- invasive genetic techniques, population dynamics can be readily assessed using fecal DNA, which is extracted from epithelial cells on the exterior of their feces. However, fecal DNA extraction and amplification success is highly variable in other coyote studies, likely due to epithelial cell degradation prior to collection. Little work has examined the influence of fecal age and storage technique relative to DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing success. During 2021, we collected > 2500 fecal samples and divided each in half, where one half was stored frozen and the other half was stored at room temperature. Prior to storage, each sample was aged: as ‘fresh’ (< 1 week old); ‘medium’ (1-3 weeks old), and ‘old’ (> 3 weeks old). To date, DNA has been extracted from >150 fecal samples, and preliminary results show that fresher samples that are stored frozen produce better quality nucleic acids, in turn better chance for successful DNA amplification. As protocols are optimized, this research will prove valuable for developing non-invasively sampled DNA libraries for future spatially explicit mark-recapture population models for coyotes in the region.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
78,Habitat Characteristics of Plains Spotted Skunks on a South Texas Rangeland,"Although they were once a common furbearer species, eastern spotted skunks (Spilogale putorius) have experienced population declines throughout large portions of its historic range. The species is now considered a species of conservation concern in many states where it occurs. The plains spotted skunk subspecies (S. p. interrupta) is currently being considered for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act. Recent research on the current distribution of spotted skunks largely omits areas of South Texas due to a lack of recent records from this area. In 2020, spotted skunks were detected as incidental captures in herpetofaunal arrays at the Welder Wildlife Refuge in Sinton, Texas. Therefore, we included spotted skunks as a part of ongoing research evaluating the effects of invasive vegetation on mammal community composition and species occupancy at the site. During July 2021, we established 24 remote camera stations spaced approximately 1 km apart across the property that will be continuously monitored for the next three years. Since July 2021, we have observed 20 unique detections (>24 hours apart) of spotted skunks at 5 camera trap locations. Generally, camera traps with spotted skunk detections contained dense understories of herbaceous and woody vegetation and canopies of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and huisache (Vachellia faresiana). These results indicate that spotted skunk populations are still present in South Texas and rangelands can provide habitat structure for the species. More research is needed to determine the distribution and spatial connectivity of this species in South Texas.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
122,Influence of Prescribed Burns on Vegetation in the Edwards Plateau,"Historically, fires were set to grassland prairies to increase forage for game species. Today, prescribed burns are used in a similar fashion to regenerate the landscape by promoting native grasses and reducing woody species encroachment. In the Edwards Plateau ecoregion of Texas at the Kerr Wildlife Management Area (WMA), in Kerr County, prescribed burns have been regenerating vegetation since 1978. With any prescribed burn, vegetation frequency, density, and species composition differ from the untouched and surrounding areas. The objective of this study is to evaluate changes in the vegetation of pastures located on the Kerr WMA before and after prescribed burns. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department employees conducted Daubenmire frame surveys for grasses, forbs, and woody species <1.5 m in height at 21 points along a 100-m transect in pastures from 2013-2021. We calculated species frequency of occurrence, percent cover, and species composition of 3 randomly selected pastures across the WMA. We chose live oak (Quercus virginiana) and the top 3 occurring species for grasses and forbs in the selected transects and will conduct an analysis of variance to determine the change for each species occurrence and percent cover after 1 treatment of cool season prescribed fire. Once completed, the Kerr WMA will use this information to help reevaluate long term goals in their prescribed burn plan as well as to inform landowners in the Edwards Plateau of the influence that prescribed burns may have on vegetation and the benefits it has on the landscape. An Assessment of Prescribed Grazing for Lesser Prairie-chickens On Beef Herd Health and Productivity Lily Evans, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Michael Whitson, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Carlos Villalobos, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Darren Hudson, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Christian Hagen, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA Blake Grisham, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Abstract: The Sand Shinnery Oak (Quercus havardii) Prairie Ecoregion population of lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus; LEPC) has recently been proposed for listing as endangered. Anthropogenic activities such as row-crop agricultural expansion, continuous domestic livestock grazing regimes, and fire suppression have reduced historic disturbance regimes and contributed to severe declines in lesser prairie-chicken occupied range and populations. In New Mexico, an Area of Critical Environmental Concern has been established and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management under their multi-use initiative. Management focuses on providing habitats that meet LEPC annual lifecycle requirements while also providing opportunities for anthropogenic use, such as hunting and cattle grazing. The use of grazing regimes to create vegetation community mosaics is supported in literature and can serve as a viable tool for land managers to create and improve habitats for LEPC populations. Research quantifying productivity and health of cattle herds used for LEPC habitat management is lacking. We used store-on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to monitor daily cattle movements that will be used to estimate cattle home ranges and core use areas by season and pasture, quantify habitat use in relation to water sources and topography, and estimate habitat use overlap with LEPCs. Additionally, quantification of herbaceous biomass, vegetative community response, vegetation nutrient content, cattle fecal nutrient deposition, and pregnancy and calving rates will be used to further evaluate cattle herd health and production in conjunction with LEPC habitat management.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
96,Spatial Ecology and Habitat Use of the Texas Alligator Lizard,"Texas Alligator Lizards, Gerrhonotus infernalis, continue to be a secretive and relatively understudied species. Due to their cryptic nature and status as a species of least concern, little effort has been made to describe the ecology and life history traits of this species in their natural habitat. Only one study to date has attempted to describe the ecological aspects of Texas Alligator Lizards, and no field research on this species has been conducted in Texas. This study aims to better describe this species ecology by collecting data on their behavior, spatial ecology, and habitat use on a seasonal basis at Selah, Bamberger Ranch Preserve, Blanco County, Texas. To date, we have captured and attempted to radio track 43 lizards (32 adults and 11 sub-adults) resulting in 7 months of overlapping data on movement activities and habitat usage. Here, we present preliminary results on temporal changes in their spatial ecology and habitat use in response to seasonal and behavioral cues, specifically for the Summer and Fall 2021 seasons. The resulting long-term data from this study will provide a necessary baseline study for Texas Hill Country populations and help us understand how stressors such as urbanization, collection (scientific or hobby), or ranch management practices may affect Texas Alligator Lizard populations. Evaluation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to Quantify Wild Pig Damage to Corn Bethany Friesenhahn, Texas A&M University Kingsville, KINGSVILLE, TX, USA Lori D. Massey, Texas A&M University Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Randy W. DeYoung, Texas A&M University Kingsville, KINGSVILLE, TX, USA Michael J. Cherry, Texas A&M University Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Justin W. Fischer, USDA, Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services, National Wildlife Research Center, Fort Collins, CO, USA Nathan P. Snow, USDA, Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services, National Wildlife Research Center, Fort Collins, CO, USA Kurt C. VerCauteren, USDA, Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services, National Wildlife Research Center, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States Humberto L. Perotto-Baldivieso, Texas A&M University Kingsville, KINGSVILLE, TX, USA Abstract: Presently, there's an estimated 6.9 million wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in the USA, causing about $1.5 billion in damage to agriculture and the environment annually. There's a need for standardized monitoring of wild pig damage and methods to accurately estimate economic costs of damage to agriculture. The objective of this study was to integrate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), harvest data, and crop phenology to quantify pig damage in corn fields. We used UAVs to monitor corn fields at different growth stages in Delta County, Texas, USA during 2019-2020. We flew 36 UAV missions and successfully classified 28 orthomosaics by manually digitizing and fully automated machine learning. We compared damage estimates from UAV imagery to those derived from ground-based transects. Finally, we compared damaged areas of fields to harvest yield maps to determine yield loss. All classified UAV orthomosaics had >80% overall accuracy, showing the capabilities of UAVs in detection and quantification of pig damage. We found ground surveys underestimated total amount of damage throughout the field by 38.6% when comparing to damage classified from 100% UAV field coverage. We observed pig damage in up to 9.2% of a field, with most damage in latter growth stages. Pig damage resulted in a mean loss of 3,416 kg of corn/ha, at a cost to producers of up to $48.24 per ha. The use of UAV monitoring will allow farmers, landowners, and agencies to accurately assess crop damage, estimate yield loss due to pigs, and ultimately determine the cost-benefit ratio of management actions. Temporal Resource Partitioning of Aoudad, Desert Bighorn Sheep, And Mule Deer in The Trans- pecos Region, Texas Olivia C. Gray, Borderlands Research Institute, Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Justin T. French, Borderlands Research Institute, Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Carlos E. Gonzalez, Borderlands Research Institute, Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Louis A. Harveson, Borderlands Research Institute, Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Froylan Hernandez, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Alpine, TX, USA Shawn Gray, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Alpine, TX, USA Abstract: Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and exotic aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) inhabit the mountainous regions of the Trans Pecos. Biologists are concerned about resource competition in co-occupied landscapes, specifically between non-native aoudad and Texas’ native ungulates. Arid regions like the Chihuahuan Desert receive little, highly seasonal rainfall, limiting the availability of water and vegetation resources. Ungulates use resources differently depending on seasonal activities (rutting, breeding, lambing, etc.). Limited resources, paired with cycles of ungulate use, may indicate temporal partitioning of resources among these three ungulate species. By examining these cycles through time, we will determine changes in resource importance and how ungulates may partition their use. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department deployed collars on 45 desert bighorn sheep (21 male, 24 female), 59 mule deer (34 male, 25 female, and 41 aoudad (33 male, 8 female) in the Van Horn Mountains from 2019 to 2020. We utilized data from these collars to inspect cyclic patterns in resource use of each species through time using autocorrelation surfaces. We examined cycles in distance to known water sources, percent shrub cover, ruggedness, and escape terrain. Preliminary results show daily cycles using rugged terrain in all ungulate species, with a seasonal shift during spring months in mule deer and aoudad. These results suggest that ungulates’ use of crucial habitats varies on daily and seasonal scales, providing an opportunity for temporal niche partitioning. Utilizing Individual Identification to Evaluate Usage of Bobcats at Wildlife Exits on A South Texas Highway Victoria Hanley, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA Zarina Sheikh, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA John H. Young, Texas Department of Transportation, Austin, TX, USA Richard J. Kline, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA Abstract: Highways in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas fragment the landscape, resulting in wildlife road mortalities, including for the federally endangered US ocelot (Leopardus pardalis). In response to ocelot-vehicle collisions, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) installed exclusion fencing along State Highway 100 (SH 100) in Cameron County, Texas. In addition, TxDOT installed ten wildlife exits with funnel-like structures to allow felids to safely exit the roadway. Due to the small population size of Texas ocelots, bobcats (Lynx rufus) are often used as a surrogate species. After 14 months, 43% of bobcats remaining in the right of way used a wildlife exit, and four exits had been used in the unintended direction of habitat to road, but it was unclear how many individuals this represented. This study uses individual identification of bobcats to determine the usage of wildlife exits, as well as evaluate the frequency of risky behaviors of individual bobcats using the exits to enter the roadway. It is important to identify bobcats to individual to determine how many may be using the mitigation structures successfully and to evaluate the frequency of risky behaviors of bobcats that cause them to enter the roadway. Transformational Wildlife Funding-Recovering America's Wildlife Act Richard Heilbrun, Texas Parks and Wildlife, San Antonio, TX, USA Abstract: Transformational wildlife funding was last seen in 1937 with the Wildlife Restoration Act (Pittman- Robertson Act). The Recovering America's Wildlife Act (HR 2773; S 2372) now before Congress would bring more than $50 million to Texas annually. Passage of this bill would provide permanent, dedicated funding to restore sensitive fish and wildlife populations, create and enhance educational programs, and improve nature- based outdoor recreation. The bill is supported by a national alliance of conservation and business groups. This presentation will include details of the funding, the organizations and networks that support and don’t support the bill, and how TCTWS, your organization, and biologists can support this national and state-wide initiative, regardless of your employer. Even in “today’s politically charged” environment, this effort is getting bipartisan support in Congress. Whatever your interests, be a part of the solution and this historic legislation. Using Large Ungulates as Sentinels to Predict Present and Future Distribution of Cattle Fever Ticks in Texas Ashley Gray Hodge, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Jeremy A. Baumgardt, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Randy W. DeYoung, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Michael J. Cherry, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Aaron M. Foley, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA David G. Hewitt, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA John A. Goolsby, USDA-ARS, Kerrville, TX, USA Kim H. Lohmeyer, USDA-ARS, Kerrville, TX, USA Abstract: Cattle fever ticks were introduced into the Americas in the early 1500’s by Spanish settlers. The ticks quickly spread throughout both North and South America. These one-host ticks can carry a deadly Babesia parasite that can be fatal in up to 90% of naïve cattle. It can also cause a reduction in meat and milk production, weight loss, and abortion. Fever ticks were eradicated from the US in the 1940’s, but remain endemic in Mexico. Although the fever tick prefers a bovid host, they can use several alternative wildlife hosts, including white-tailed deer. We captured deer in a high-density population surrounding Falcon Lake near Zapata, Texas. The site is located along the US-Mexico border, inside a permanent quarantine zone established to prevent re-emergence of the tick in the US. We fitted 100 deer with GPS collars that collected hourly fixes and removed 298 females from the area to reduce density of host animals; we recorded capture locations and tick loads from all deer. We are using ecological niche models to understand how local site characteristics are associated with abundance of ticks. Home ranges of infested deer will serve as occurrence data, and covariates will include landscape metrics such as ecological site description, land cover, precipitation, distance to Ivermectin feeders maintained to treat deer, temperature, and pasture treatments for cattle. The outputs will further inform us on environmental variables important to ticks at a macro scale, and highlight areas that may be impacted by future northward range expansions of the tick.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
131,Population Density and Breeding Success of American Kestrels in Erath County,"Ever since the DDT scare of the 1960s-1970s, American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) have been on scientists’ watch lists due to population declines. This study will occur in Erath County, Texas in the Cross Timbers ecoregion. The objectives of this study are to determine the density of kestrels in the county during the breeding season, determine the optimal locations for nest boxes, examine breeding success, and examine competition for use of nest boxes. In spring 2022, we will conduct weekly roadside population surveys of American Kestrels in and around Erath County to estimate density and identify potential breeding locations. In the fall of 2022 and the spring semester of 2023, we will set up nest boxes in areas predicted to be used by breeding kestrels to monitor breeding success and possible use by competing species. This study will help identify possible threats to kestrel breeding populations in Erath County. Broad-scale Population Trend for The California Quail in California: Inferences from A Cycling Population Sarah Jacobson, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Leonard Brennan, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Humberto Perotto-Baldivieso, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Evan Tanner, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Katherine Miller, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Sacramento, CA, USA Abstract: The California quail (Callipepla californica) is an important upland gamebird for the Pacific region of the United States. During the past half century, large regions in California have become increasingly fragmented and degraded as a result of urban development, altered forest and rangeland management, and large-scale agriculture. These and other factors could threaten the persistence of California quail in some areas. Our goal was to determine the long-term population trend of the California quail at the state extent for California. We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (1968-2019) to create relative abundance maps and developed 5- year-averages to account for annual variability in abundance. We then established 50 spatially balanced random points to calculate mean birds/route from 1970-2017. The California quail population displayed a clear cycle- driven pattern over time, with a small peak in the early 1980s and larger peaks in the mid-1990s and late 2000s. Fitting a time series autocorrelation function indicated that the California quail population was stationary with an endogenously generated periodicity. Possible explanations include broad-scale responses to climatic patterns, especially widespread drought, and a combination of increasing and decreasing populations at local scales. Currently we are identifying areas with declining and increasing populations and will compare road density, human population density, and land use between them. The information gathered from this study will provide a quantitative basis for wildlife biologists and stakeholders to prioritize areas for quail population and habitat conservation on a state-wide basis for California. Song Diversity of Bachman’S Sparrows in East Texas Kasey L. Jobe, Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, Texas, United States Abstract: Birds rely heavily on vocalizations to communicate within their. Bachman's Sparrows (Peucaea aestivalis) exhibit large song repertoires in the eastern portion of their range. However, categorization of the song repertoires from the western subspecies has not been well documented. We sought to qualify the song repertoire and investigate the frequency of song type use in Bachman’s Sparrow in East Texas. We identified and quantified song types from five sites passively monitored with automated sound recorders from February to August 2020 (n = 5 days per month).[SDF1] . We used chi-square to determine if frequency of song type differed from what would be expected by chance. Across our sampling period, we transcribed 5,127 Bachman’s Sparrow songs and classified them into 6 different song types. Three song types were used significantly more than expected by chance (overall frequency of occurrence: 28%, 21%, and 20%). The most frequently used song types were similar in their structure and had high frequencies with long trills. A diversity of song types that span the spectrum of acoustic space may enhance opportunities for these signals to be received by potential mates and competitors while minimizing acoustic interference with conspecifics and heterospecifics. The most frequently used songs may be most effective at conveying these signals, but the ecological contexts in which these song types are used need to be examined further.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
67,Northern Bobwhite Response to Habitat Restoration in Eastern Texas,"Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; bobwhite) once occupied a large portion of the Piney Woods ecoregion of Texas. After decades of land use changes and fire suppression, habitat has become fragmented and bobwhite have all but been extirpated from the region. During 2020, we initiated habitat restoration on a private property in Polk County, TX, USA with a goal of restoring 3,440 ha of bobwhite habitat. Initial timber volume was 21.9 m2 / ha in May 2021. Timber thinning is ongoing and expected to be complete by December 2023; target basal area is 9 m2 / ha. Our objectives are to document bobwhite response over time using a robust design occupancy model with a before-after-control-impact approach to evaluate habitat and management factors associated with occupancy, colonization, and extirpation. We completed surveys (n = 98) for the first primary session during 15 May - 15 June 2021 at 14 sites to document initial occupancy; no bobwhite were detected during surveys. Translocation will be used to restore the northern bobwhite population to this fragmented landscape because bobwhite have not responded to habitat management efforts. The results from this study will be used to inform future northern bobwhite restoration efforts in the Piney Woods ecoregion of Texas.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
124,Bobwhite Response to Cattle Grazing in South Texas,"Range management practices to improve habitat for wildlife by reducing brush and increasing herbaceous plants, coupled with reduced stocking rates, can lead to dense stands of dominant grasses, such as Four-flower Trichloris (Trichloris pluriflora). This monoculture of Four-flower Trichloris creates dense unsuitable vegetation for Northern Bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus). The objectives of this study are to evaluate the use of a proper cattle grazing regime to maintain or improve bobwhite habitat, as well as develop a management guide documenting how cattle grazing can be used as a tool to reduce the density and cover of dominant grasses. The study area is composed of two pastures, totaling about 2,500 hectares, in Duval County, Texas. One pasture will serve as the control while the other will be grazed to maintain a stubble height between 30 and 40 centimeters (optimal for bobwhite habitat) as needed. We placed 10 grazing exclosures as well as 10 (25 meter) transects within each treatment to determine botanical composition and cover. Double sampling is completed monthly to determine forage standing crop, and percent cover is also recorded along each transect at each meter. We have also completed an aerial survey of the study area and the results indicate that quail density on the grazed pasture is roughly 60% higher compared to the non-grazed. The results so far are preliminary however it has the potential to shed light on how bobwhites respond to proper cattle grazing which in turn may be used for managing their habitat across South Texas.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
110,Assessment Of Environmental Contaminants in Obligate Avian Scavengers,"Obligate scavengers such as turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) and black vultures (Coragyps atratus) can be indicators of contaminants present in the environment. This is primarily due to their functional dietary role, which may facilitate intraspecific exposure to diseases and environmental toxicants. Moreover, migratory behavior can lead to increased exposure of these contaminants, thus leading to the potential for spatially dynamic exposure frequencies. Our objective was to determine the contaminants present in both species of vultures within the southern region of the Central Migratory Flyway, as well as the antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria found within individuals. Vultures were captured in March and November, 2021, and cloacal swabs and blood samples were taken from individuals to monitor fungal/bacterial organisms and lead levels in birds, respectively. Many potentially pathogenic bacteria were found in high frequencies of the vultures. Escherichia coli was present in 100% of the black vultures captured in March, while Salmonella sp. were found in 60%. Chlamydia was found in 36% of birds tested in November, while Trichosporon asahii was found in 6%. Analysis of antibiotic resistance indicated that the Salmonella strain present was resistant to many of the tested antibiotics. Blood lead levels varied from below 3.4 micrograms per deciliter to over 56.6 micrograms per deciliter. Our research illustrates the potential zoonotic pathogens and anthropogenic lead toxicants that exist within this important migratory flyway. Given that these species are obligate scavengers, our results may be indicative of broader contaminants that are exposed to wildlife communities within this system.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
107,Reaction of Nilgai to Motion Activated Sprayer Systems for Cattle Fever Tick Management,"Domestic livestock are often exposed to pathogens and diseases by wildlife. Nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are an exotic, free-ranging ungulate in South Texas. Nilgai are a competent host of cattle fever ticks (CFT; Rhipicephalus (=Boophilus) microplus and R. (B.) annulatus) that can carry Babesia parasites, the cause of bovine babesiosis, a disease detrimental to livestock. There are no viable methods to target nilgai for CFT treatment. The USDA-ARS created a motion-activated sprayer system to spray nilgai with a solution containing entomopathogenic nematodes. The sprayer systems were set up at fence crossing locations as nilgai use gaps in fences to move throughout South Texas. The goals of this study were to 1) determine if nilgai avoided the areas with sprayers, and 2) determine if the presence of sprayers affected how fast a nilgai crossed the fence. The sprayers were deployed in February 2019 and removed from the field in October 2019. We recorded the frequency of nilgai at fence crossings with (4 weeks prior to removal) and without (4 weeks after removal) the sprayers. We also calculated how long nilgai spent around the sprayers prior to crossing. Preliminary results suggest that nilgai appeared at fence crossings more often when there was no sprayer present. Factors that might have influenced the change in crossing behavior are the frequency of human activity at the sprayer sites and time of the year. Sprayer systems may require time for nilgai to become accustomed to their presence to be an effective treatment for CFT on nilgai. Monitoring the Effectiveness of Redesigned Wildlife Exits Along a South Texas Highway Jamie Langbein, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA Kevin Ryer, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA John Young Jr., Texas Department of Transportation, Austin, TX, USA Richard Kline, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA Abstract: Roadside exclusion fencing is commonly used to mitigate wildlife road mortalities as well as property damages caused by wildlife-vehicle collisions. A potentially lethal effect of exclusion fencing is that animals may become trapped on the roadside of the fence and unable to leave the right-of-way. On State Highway 100 in Cameron County, Texas, TxDOT modified segments of fencing to install ten wildlife exits as a solution that would allow animals to escape the roadway by exiting through a modified opening in the fence. However, in the initial design, some individuals learned to use the wildlife exits in reverse to enter the roadway within a year. In this study, a new design of wildlife exit was implemented, with narrower openings, a steep ramp and a clear plastic one-way door. These new wildlife exits will be monitored using camera traps as well as a video camera attached to an infrared trip wire sensor to capture wildlife interactions with the new wildlife exits. Preliminary data will provide insights into wildlife responses to a novel road mitigation structure and help shape any future modifications needed to provide animals with a safe, accessible way to exit dangerous roadside habitat.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
106,Arthropod Biodiversity in Response to Juniper Removal Within Riparian Buffers,"Riparian ecosystems are declining globally due to increased anthropogenic and ecological pressures, including the encroachment of woody vegetation such as Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei). Presence of Ashe juniper influences inter- and intracommunity dynamics by suppressing understory growth and outcompeting other native herbaceous and woody vegetation, thus affecting arthropod biodiversity. Arthropod communities play a critical role in the environment for their ability to promote or disrupt ecological processes through mechanisms like herbivory, decomposition, pollination, parasitism, or as food sources to other wildlife. Our objectives are to 1) survey arthropod community richness and diversity in response to juniper removal along riparian corridors and 2) monitor for seasonal or structural variation in species using presence-absence data. We surveyed from May to July 2021 during peak arthropod production along intermittent and ephemeral streambeds on a 182-ha property adjacent to Palo Pinto Mountains State Park in Stephens County, TX. We sampled a total of 12 sites within riparian areas with 6 that underwent juniper removal and 6 left undisturbed. To maximize efficiency in sampling across arthropod communities, we use pitfall traps and vacuum sampling. We will compare species richness and focal-species occurrence between removed and undisturbed sites. Developing an understanding of arthropod community structure in response to juniper presence can aid in future research regarding habitat mitigation and restoration. Additionally, by evaluating the impact of juniper removal on arthropod productivity, adaptive management strategies can be implemented for other faunal communities.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
137,Effect of Microclimate on Nest Selection and Nesting Success in the Black-crested Titmouse,"Cavity nesting birds choose nest sites non-randomly based on many factors. Hypotheses to explain nest choice include 1) nest-hole orientation, which influences wind exposure; 2) solar radiation, which influences nest temperature; and 3) vegetation density surrounding a nest, which may influence access to food resources and may provide protection from predators. We study how nest-box features affect occupancy and nesting success in the Black-Crested Titmouse (Aves; Baeolophus atricristatus), a secondary cavity-nesting bird found in Texas, Oklahoma, and Mexico. 99 nest boxes were established approximately 30 km north of San Antonio. We recorded nest occupancy and measures of nesting success (number of eggs laid, number of eggs hatched, number of nestlings fledged) in 2019 and 2021. We estimated vegetation density by calculating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) within a radius of 10 meters around each nestbox using ArcMap (ERSI). NDVI analyzes light reflection from vegetation using satellite imagery. Solar radiation was calculated via Gap Light Analyzer (GLA) based on semi-hemispherical photos taken from above the nest using Google Street View. Each nest box was monitored via weekly checks from February to July. Analyses are ongoing. A finding of nonrandom distribution of nest box occupancy or nesting success would suggest that the Black-Crested Titmouse chooses nest boxes with ideal microclimate conditions or vegetative properties. Results will clarify which environmental factors affect reproductive success of this understudied species, and furthermore, will inform optimal placement of artificial nests.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
93,Inventorying Woody Vegetation Using Remote Sensing Techniques in South Texas,"Honey mesquite trees (Prosopis glandulosa) are commonly found in South Texas rangelands and are problematic due to their ability to spread rapidly. Mesquite trees left unmanaged tend to take over and crowd out more desirable vegetation that is important to maintain healthy rangelands, leading to an overall decrease in plant diversity that subsequently also lowers wildlife species diversity. Diversity of both plant and wildlife species is crucial for rangelands in order to prevent serious problems related to brush encroachment such as soil erosion, depleted soil nutrient content, and poor water infiltration. Our specific objectives were 1) Determine if we could use RGB imagery to detect different species of woody vegetation throughout the study site 2) Quantify the species composition across the study site. In this study we used UAV imagery of a 102-ha research facility, South Pasture, in Kleberg County to identify different woody species cover through supervised image classification. We used the regular RGB camera from the UAV along with GPS points collected in the field of different woody species. The ability to classify RGB imagery opens the field of vegetation sampling and inventorying to modern technology. This technique could provide managers with a better understanding of their property to create a management plan based off the species diversity or lack of diversity in an area. It could also increase efficiency spent in the field inventorying species. UAVs paired with GIS could possibly be the next field inventorying method to remotely identify woody vegetation of rangelands in South Texas.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
97,Avian Community Dynamics Within a Riparian Corridor: A 12 Year Perspective,"North American avifauna has declined nearly 30% due to habitat loss, climatic change, and unidentified factors. Temporal changes in species composition or declining bird populations are critical parameters to evaluate the maintenance of biodiversity. Assessing the temporal changes in bird communities in migratory zones is crucial. We aim to examine the long-term temporal dynamics of an avian community and to identify any observed population trends of the most abundant species. Our study site is located on the edge of the Central Migratory Flyway on the Welder Wildlife Foundation. Utilizing the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol, we compared the community dynamics of birds from the Summers of 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2021. Specifically, we compared the species diversity, i.e., the effective number of species, the rank abundance curves, and the species composition among years. We found a similar species diversity over years. From the rank abundance curves we observed consistency over years of the most abundant species, Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), however, they exhibited a decrease in abundance. We also observed shifts in the second and third most abundant species in all sampled periods. Despite the similar species diversity and the relative consistency of the most abundant species, we found that the species composition of the community changed over the years. We emphasize that the changes of bird communities over years, with special concern with the declining of avian populations, can be the result of changes in habitat and/or environment conditions locally or regionally.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
105,Estimating the Feasibility of Thermal Drones for Wildlife Surveys in South Texas,"Unmanned aerial systems (UASs or drones) and increased availability of thermal infrared imaging provide new opportunities for wildlife surveys. Traditional surveys via manned aircrafts serve as the greatest cause of death for people in the wildlife field. Drones can eliminate the risk that comes with manned aerial surveys as well as being less expensive and have been shown to create a lower disturbance rate. Previous studies have been conducted during daylight or twilight hours due to the regulation of flying after civil twilight hours. Recent changes in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) drone regulations now allow for nighttime flights when drones are equipped with anti-collision lights. Therefore, there are opportunities to evaluate nighttime flight surveys to determine their viability for estimating wildlife populations. We want to test the effectiveness of using a drone equipped with a thermal camera to survey white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in South Texas. We will survey a 102-hectare high-fenced property that serves as the South Pasture Research Facility for Texas A&M University-Kingsville. Our specific objectives for this study are 1) assess the feasibility of detecting deer with isotherm gradient technology compared to traditional thermal imagery 2) compare detectability of deer between video footage and still photographs using distance sampling techniques and 3) compare population estimates between game camera and drone surveys.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
112,"Population Assessment of Semi Aquatic Turtles in the Cross Timbers Ecoregion, Texas, USA","Turtles make up a large component of vertebrate fauna in the world but populations have been steadily declining in many areas across the globe. Understanding movement patterns and population demographics of semi-aquatic turtles will help inform management and conservation of species. Persistence of some turtle populations depends upon the ability of individual animals to move to more suitable locations during dry periods and this movement might have consequences for survival and recruitment into populations. The objective of this study is to evaluate population dynamics of semi-aquatic turtles and examine movement and connectivity among isolated water sources. Starting in spring 2021, we began mark-recapture efforts at water sources across the Muse Wildlife Management Area (789 ha) in Brown County, Texas. In summer 2021 we placed VHF radio-telemetry transmitters on red-ear sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), the most common turtle, to document seasonal movement among water sources and identify potential barriers. We have had 58 successful trapping days (of 90 days with traps deployed) and we marked 113 individuals (52 male and 57 female red-eared sliders, 3 common snapping turtle [Chelydra serpentine] and 2 yellow mud turtles [Kinosternon flavescens flavescens]). We marked approximately 16 juveniles and 93 adults red-eared sliders and have documented movement between locations for 6 red-ear sliders. We will continue to collect data through fall 2022. This study will provide knowledge of semi-aquatic turtle population dynamics and their movements and will assist with management and conservation efforts.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
116,Short-term Weather Variables Affect Avian Body Condition,"Understanding how birds respond to shifting weather patterns and acute weather events is critical for effectively understanding broader ecosystem dynamics. However, few studies have investigated how short-term weather variables affect birds at the level of the individual, especially among songbirds (Order: Passeriformes). Here we use body condition, quantified through scaled mass index, to assess the impact of precipitation, daily maximum temperature, and daily minimum temperature on various songbird species and guilds in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. We coupled avian morphometric data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship program with weather data from the nearest corresponding weather station to each site, and used linear mixed models to identify the relative effects of each weather variable (and interactions thereof) on each avian species. Additionally, we grouped a total of 18 avian species into guilds to represent dietary, habitat, and migratory differences between species groups. Preliminary results indicate that monthly and annual precipitation totals more strongly influence body condition of granivorous species, and that precipitation and temperature together influence body condition of species across dietary and habitat guilds. Since changing weather patterns are already widely known to affect birds at the level of the population and the community, it is important to note that effects are also apparent at the level of the individual.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
141,A Comparison of Sparrow Diversity in Northeast Texas,"Populations of North American grassland sparrows have dramatically declined over the past decades. Habitat loss and fragmentation continue to occur, which adversely affects sparrow populations and sparrow diversity. In addition, there is little knowledge of wintering sparrow habitat since most research has focused on the breeding grounds. Previous studies suggest that sparrow occurrence highly correlates with vegetation structure. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine what types of vegetation structure supports higher sparrow diversity on a 2,691-ha military base in Lamar County, Texas. We created 20-m x 100-m transects using a stratified random sampling approach across post oak savanna vegetation communities at 15 sites to survey wintering sparrows from 3 December 2020 - 13 March 2021. We used a double-observer flushing technique and recorded all sparrow species observed. We measured fine-scale vegetation structure and species composition along sparrow survey transects using Daubenmire frames and the line-intercept method in March 2021 along sparrow survey transects. We will calculate the mean vegetation measurements by averaging data collected at all survey transects. We will use the Shannon Diversity Index to measure sparrow species diversity and AIC model selection to determine what vegetation metrics best predict diversity. Our findings will help us better manage grassland ecosystems in a way that supports the specific vegetation components required for greater sparrow use and diversity on their wintering grounds.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
76,Comparison of Traffic and Noise Levels Along Two Highways in Southern Texas,"Roads can create a road-effect zone that influences wildlife behavior and survival, which can be expanded by increased traffic volumes. In Cameron County, the Texas Department of Transportation constructed nine wildlife crossing structures (WCS) with non-continuous exclusion fencing on Farm-to-Market (FM) 106 and five WCS and 18 wildlife guards with continuous exclusion fencing on State Highway (SH) 100, to mitigate endangered ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) road mortalities. Our objectives were to: 1) describe the traffic volumes on each road; and 2) describe the noise levels along each road and at each WCS; and 3) determine if traffic and noise levels influence wildlife interactions with WCS. WCS were monitored with camera trap arrays that consisted of four cameras on each side. To monitor traffic volume, two cameras with trip sensors were deployed on FM106 and SH100. Noise levels were monitored with NSRT_mk3 sound level meters at each WCS and the surrounding area. The traffic volumes between roads were compared with a t-test. An analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was used to compare average noise levels between WCS, and a t-test was used to compare average noise level between roads. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to examine if there were associations between noise levels, traffic volume, and frequency of use of WCS by target wildlife species. This study will help establish a baseline noisescape for each highway and contribute to the understanding of how traffic and noise influence the use of wildlife crossing structures by ocelot and other wildlife.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
117,Herptile Microhabitat Use in the Cross Timbers Ecoregion of Texas,"Due to its large size, Texas has a multitude of ecoregions that provide habitat for reptiles and amphibians. Herptiles use microhabitats for foraging, escaping weather, and regulating body temperature. The objective of this research is to evaluate the use of microhabitats by herptiles in the Palo Pinto Mountains State Park in Stephens County, Texas. Our study area is a 182-ha property in the Cross Timbers ecoregion. The property comprises 2 ponds, and ephemeral and intermittent streams, and it is dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata) and Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei). We selected 15 plots, that vary in size, with rocks, logs, natural or established brush piles, and litter. Starting in June 2021, we conducted morning (0700-1200), mid-day (1200- 1600), and evening (1600-2100) surveys that involve flipping rocks and logs, and examining brush piles and litter. For each detection, we measure wind speed, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and soil temperature. Collectively, we had 30 detections (17 morning, 2 mid-day, and 10 evening). We will resume surveys in March of 2022 and will record measurements at unoccupied locations to compare with occupied areas. We will add temperature of the underside of rocks and logs, soil moisture, and soil texture to our microhabitat data. This information will contribute to our knowledge of the community assemblage and habitat requirements for herptiles in the Cross Timbers region of Texas and will assist with the management and conservation of those species. Quantifying Population Trends and Habitat for The Chestnut-Bellied Scaled Quail in South Texas Dakota Raine Moberg, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Kingsville, TX, USA Lori Massey, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Kingsville, TX, USA Humberto L. Perotto-Baldivieso, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Kingsville, TX, USA Evan P. Tanner, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Kingsville, TX, USA Leonard A. Brennan, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Kingsville, TX, USA Jesus G. Franco-Pizana, Rio Grande Joint Venture and America Bird Conservancy, McAllen, TX, USA Abstract: The chestnut-bellied scaled quail (Callipepla squamata castanogastris; herafter ‘scaled quail’) is an upland game bird that has experienced declines in abundance across its geographic distribution. Declines in the South Texas Plains were not as strong as in other regions until the 2000s. Proposed hypotheses for the declines of scaled quail suggest rangeland deterioration and changes in land use. Major drivers of land use change in the region are oil/gas and urban development that has altered vegetation landscape structure and composition. Our goal was to develop a framework to identify the conservation and management priorities in the South Texas Plains for scaled quail habitat. To achieve our goal, we first identified and quantified spatial trends in scaled quail abundance in the region. Our study area was located in the South Texas Plains ecoregions with a focus on four counties: Jim Hogg, Starr, Zapata, and Webb. We used the Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) to evaluate landscape changes between 1984 and 2020. Scaled quail numbers per route have decreased from 16 birds per route in the late 1970s to ~3 birds per route since 2011. Data from RAP shows that tree cover percentage has significantly increased in all four counties. Field data confirmed that tree cover is linked to honey mesquite cover and the presence of invasive herbaceous species in the understory vegetation. We noted that as invasive species are present, the number of thornscrub species may decrease. All these factors negatively affect scaled quail habitat distribution and potentially connectivity.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
82,Playing ‘Hide and Seek’ With Texas Tortoises: Value of a Detector Dog,"Texas tortoises (Gopherus berlandieri) were once considered common and abundant throughout southern Texas with densities as high as 16 tortoises per hectare. Today, density estimates are 0.25 tortoises per hectare, which constitutes about a 98% population decline. Thus because of their low numbers and elusive behavior, Texas tortoises can be difficult to find. We demonstrate the value of using a detector dog as a time saving method in locating Texas tortoises. We glued VHF radio transmitters on 9 adult tortoises and released them in a 3 ha plowed and short-grass pasture that contained mesquite mottes. We calculated the Detectability Index (DI) as the detection rate (# tortoises found/minute) x percent tortoises from the known population found within 60 minutes. We compared DI’s via telemetry, detector dog, and ‘cold’ (no equipment or knowledge) searches. We used the time it required to find all tortoises when the searcher had knowledge of locations as the baseline. Our baseline DI was 0.78, followed by telemetry (0.109) and detector dogs (0.106), while ‘cold’ searches was 0.03. Telemetry, detector dog, and cold searches were 8X, 11X, and nearly 60X slower, respectively, than knowledge of tortoise locations. However, the combination of using detector dogs with telemetry resulted in a 25% time savings. Telemetry was useful is locating an area with a tortoise but a detector dog was 2X faster in locating the tortoise once the area was identified. Therefore, we recommend the use of detector dogs as a time-saving method when conducting research on Texas tortoises. Quantifying Increasing Temperatures From 2021-2060 Using Global Climate Models: Potential Implications for Woody Cover Encroachment Amanda L. Montemayor, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Kingsville, TX, USA Annalysa M. Camacho, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Kingsville, TX, USA Humberto L. Perotto-Baldivieso, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Kingsville, TX, USA Evan P. Tanner, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Kingsville, TX, USA Shad D. Nelson, Mary Lewis Kleberg College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Kingsville, Texas, United States Dwain Daniels, Central National Technology Support Center USDA NRCS, Forth Worth, TX, USA Abstract: Temperatures are changing globally in response to external forces, such as solar radiation, atmospheric aerosols, and internal interactions between components of the climate system. This change may create functional habitat loss, and shifts in species distributions for vegetation and wildlife. Predicting temperature changes for rangelands is important because they can experience an increased spread of invasive species, specifically woody plant encroachment. Across the globe, grasslands have been converted to woodlands, affecting ecological processes, species diversity, composition, and habitat structure and function. The objectives of our research is to (1) assess the rate of change in temperature and precipitation across Texas and (2) to identify the potential areas subject to woody cover encroachment based on climate parameters. To achieve this, we plan to use ensemble maps of coupled climate models to simulate mean monthly temperature and precipitation projections at a county level for the years 2021-2060. We used the WorldClim database for high spatial resolution global climate data. We acquired temperature and precipitation data from seven global circulation models and four shared socio- economic pathways. We found that model variation projected a one to six degree increase in temperature (°C) and a decrease of 71mm to an increase of 93mm in rainfall over the next 40 years. This research will identify the least resilient areas subject to woody cover encroachment based on temperature and precipitation changes projected across Texas which can then assist in improved management decision processes. Population Density of Northern Cottonmouth Snakes (A.piscivorus) Within Constructed Wetland Complexes Sarah Jean Morris, Texas A&M University-Commerce, Commerce, TX, USA Abstract: Northern cottonmouth snakes (Agkistrodon piscivorus) have been found across the south-central United States up to the Atlantic coastal plain. They can be found in semi-aquatic habitats such as swamps, ponds, lakes, and even in wetland complexes and are indicator species. At Texas A&M University-Commerce, there is a constructed artificial wetland complex with many types of species. This research aimed to observe the population density of the cottonmouth snakes in the wetland complexes to understand the role A. piscivorus provides in this habitat using distance sampling. The snakes were located from transects and tagged using Biomark PIT tags to collect data for the population model. Using Program R, the data was analyzed using the distance package to provide the detectability of A. piscivorus and the estimated population abundance. The results for the detectability showed that the data collected wasn’t conclusive to distance sampling. It says that we perfectly detect all cottonmouths out to the maximum detection distance. The density of the snakes was 4.899624 per ha, multiplied by 45 ha, producing an estimate of 220 with a confidence interval ranging from 115 to 423 individuals that possibly occupy these constructed wetlands, which follows with the original hypothesis. Further research can be done to understand the genetic diversity within these snakes from different wetland locations to develop more information on them. Since they're an indicator species, this information can be used for habitat management as well. Population And Parasitism Rate Estimates for Black-capped Vireos in Kickapoo Caverns State Park - 2021 Brendan M. Mulhall, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA M. Clay Green, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA James J. Giocomo, American Bird Conservancy, Durand, IL, USA Abstract: The black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) was delisted from the U.S. Endangered Species List by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 2018. As part of the USFWS Post-Delisting Monitoring Plan, population surveys and brown-headed cowbird parasitism rate estimates were undertaken to estimate current population size (i.e. territories) to compare with population estimates prior to 2018. We performed point count surveys at 41 randomly selected points within Kickapoo Caverns State Park to determine a density estimate that served as our population estimate. Point counts were performed periodically between May 13, 2021 to June 30, 2021. We also performed nest searching and monitoring of black-capped vireo nests to examine how many nests were being parasitized throughout the park. Nest monitoring occurred throughout the entire field season, May 3, 2021 to July 13, 2021. We detected a total of 32 singing males at 15 of our 41 survey locations (36.59% of points). An end of season count of territories visited throughout the season provided an estimate of 134 black-capped vireo territories found within park boundaries. A total of 22 black-capped vireo nests were located and monitored throughout the season, 4 (18%) of these nests were parasitized. A total of 10 (45%) of the 22 nests succeeded to fledging. This is the first year of a multi-year study on black-capped vireo populations on Texas Parks and Wildlife Department managed lands in the Western Edwards Plateau. This study will help inform management decisions for black-capped vireo populations.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
77,Modification to Existing Wildlife Guards to Prevent Wildlife Use Along a South Texas Highway,"To mitigate ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) road mortalities, the Texas Department of Transportation installed continuous fencing, 16 wildlife guards (WG), and five wildlife crossing structures (WCS) along an 11.9 km stretch of State Highway 100 in Cameron County, Texas. Fencing and WGs were intended to prevent wildlife from accessing the road and WCSs provided a way for wildlife to safely cross under the road. While these measures prevent some wildlife species from accessing the road, species such as coyote and bobcat are only partially deterred by WGs, raising concerns that ocelots may also not be deterred and use WGs to enter the road. Two types of WG have been deployed: bridge-grate (BGWG) and pipe (PWG). Our main objective is to determine the effectiveness of WG modifications in preventing bobcats, and by extension ocelots, from accessing the road. Modifications to WGs include 1) a vehicle gate and 2) adding deterrent spike strips (Shark Teeth™) along the edges of the WGs and on the underlying support beam. Three PWGs and four BGWGs will be modified with Shark Teeth and two PWGs will be gated; the remaining seven unmodified WGs will continue to be monitored. Differences in wildlife use of WGs with and without the deterrents will be compared. The results of this study will be used to determine if vehicle gates and Shark Teeth are effective deterrents or if additional deterrent methods should be considered to prevent bobcat, coyote, and possibly ocelot from accessing the road.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
113,A Habitat Suitability Index Model for Giraffe (Giraffa Camelopardalis) in Southern Africa,"In 2018, the IUCN listed giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) as vulnerable with a decreasing trend in abundance and estimated 68,000 remaining individuals. Throughout much of southern Africa, giraffes exist as a metapopulation confined to reserves, with an intervening matrix dominated by agriculture and other development. Significantly expanding the existing population will rely on establishing additional giraffe herds in currently unoccupied reserves. The goal of our project was to develop a hierarchical habitat suitability index model for giraffes, for use by conservation planners to estimate the success of potential reintroductions. Our model utilizes landscape-level habitat variables and local-level vegetation variables to predict habitat suitability. We deployed cameras and measured local-level field data at two fenced-in reserves currently supporting giraffe populations - Hans Merensky Nature Reserve (5,362 ha) and Vygeboom Nature Reserve (6,629 ha), adjacent reserves located in Limpopo Province, South Africa. During Dec 2019 - Feb 2020, we deployed 88 camera traps across a two-km × two-km grid across the study sites, each trap consisted of paired infrared game cameras. At each trap site, we collected data on vegetation type and structure, including tree species composition, canopy cover, density, height, and diameter at breast height. We detected giraffes at 28 traps. We will evaluate habitat use of giraffe using an occupancy-modeling approach based on species occurrence and vegetation data. Our results will allow conservation planners to make better-informed and more efficient decisions when expanding the existing giraffe reserve network. Niche Divergence of a Drought Deciduous Shrub and Its Implications on Range Expansion Under Changing Climate Scenarios Katie J. Pennartz, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Evan P. Tanner, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Anthony Falk, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Megan K. Clayton, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension, Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, Corpus Christi, TX, USA Humberto L. Perotto-Baldivieso, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Abstract: Niche divergence is an ecological pattern that favors adaptive plasticity in species to persist in variable environments. Whitebrush (Aloysia gratissima) is a shrub species with two geographically distinct populations occurring in Central and South America that is currently expanding its distribution and exists in areas with a variety of environmental conditions. This species’ tolerance can be explained in part by its drought deciduous nature and resilient reproductive traits. Our goal was to explore the environmental variables that constrain distribution spread and how they vary in importance between the two distinct populations. We constructed ecological niche models using MaxEnt to compare relationships between populations and their abiotic environment. We created a model for the entire known species’ distribution and then compared it to model performance metrics and variable contributions from models focused on the northern and southern populations. We then modeled the northern and southern populations independently and assessed model transferability across disparate populations. Finally, distribution shifts were modeled under future climate scenarios. Individual population models outperformed the overall species model suggesting niche divergence is occurring between the two populations. Differences in the top performing variables across disparate population models suggested the northern population is limited by minimum temperature extremes while the southern population is limited by moisture availability. Predicting species behavior and identifying driving interactions will allow for adaptive management strategies in current and future climate scenarios. Comparing the Distribution of White-tailed Deer Before and After an Extreme Climate Event: Winter Storm Uri in Texas Daniel Javier Ramirez, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Chloe Bates, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Humberto L. Perotto-Baldivieso, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA William P. Kuvlesky, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Joshua Allison, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Meghan Anderson, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA J.

Lombardi, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Thomas J. Yamashita, Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Willis Sontheimer, Texas Military Department, Austin, TX, USA Abstract: Extreme climatic events can cause high intensity and low-frequency disturbances which can cause changes in population abundance, distribution, and changes in habitat structure and composition. In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri brought bands of light-heavy snow, ice, and subzero temperatures (0℃) across Texas. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is a common, economically valuable, and native large game species in Texas. Extreme climatic events have been linked to ungulate survival, habitat use, and movement; Our objective is to analyze the distribution of white-tailed deer before, during, and after the winter outbreak of 2021. During the storm, we had two large camera trap arrays deployed across two military sites: Camp Bowie (Brownwood, TX) and Camp Swift (Bastrop, TX). The cameras on each site are distributed in a grid pattern based on a concurrent upland bird study, collecting the time and temperature of when a deer detection event occurred. The images that the camera traps collected, will be to identify bucks, does, or fawns and document the number of individuals observed in the photograph. A database will be created with locations, kept date and time, temperature, developing a spatially explicit occupancy model during and after the winter outbreak of 2021. This research should provide new insights into how extreme thermal dynamics drive white-tailed deer distribution. Morphometric, Coloration, and Behavioral Differences Between Plateau and Tamaulipan Spot- tailed Earless Lizards Drake Rangel, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Christin Moeller, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Luke Willard, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Scott E. Henke, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Cord B. Eversole, Texas A&M International University, Laredo, TX, USA Ruby Ayala, Texas A&M International University, Laredo, TX, USA Brian K. Loflin, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Abstract: Spot-tailed earless lizard (STEL; Holbrookia lacerata) originally was a single species that was separated into 2 subspecies, the Plateau (H. l. lacerata) and the Tamaulipan (H. l. subcaudalis) subspecies. Today, the lizards are considered two distinct species because of genetic differences (Maldonado et al. 2020), with the Balcones Escarpment fault line separating the northern (H. lacerata) from the southern (H. subcaudalis) populations. Herein, we offer morphometric, coloration, and behavioral differences as additional evidence to maintain the 2 species of STEL as distinct species. Tamaulipan STEL are larger (P < 0.01) by snout-vent length (SVL) and weight in both males and females (Tamaulipan males: 9.9 ± 0.7 cm and 61.9 ± 1.2 g, respectively, versus Plateau males: 7.5 ± 0.4 cm and 55.3 ± 1.2 g, respectively; Tamaulipan females: 10.7 ± 0.5 cm and 66.2 ± 0.9 g, respectively, versus Plateau females: 8.4 ± 0.4 cm and 58.8 ± 1.2 g, respectively). Within species, sexes were similar in size (P > 0.10), except Tamaulipan females were heavier (P < 0.02) than males. In addition, Tamaulipan STEL were gray in color compared to a tan brown color of Plateau STEL. The RGB quantification for Tamaulipan STEL was greater (Red: 186 ± 4 vs. 154 ± 4; Green: 169 ± 4 vs. 142 ±4; Blue: 149 ± 5 vs. 127 ± 5; P < 001) than Plateau STEL. Lastly, Tamaulipan STEL appeared faster, ran further, and behaved more skittishly than Plateau STEL. Evidence warrants maintaining the separation of these species. Correlation Among Demographic Rates and the Influence of Catastrophic Weather Events on Montezuma Quail in The Trans-Pecos Of Texas Maya A. Ressler, Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Justin French, Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Fidel Hernández, Texas A&M University–Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Ryan Luna, Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Abstract: Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae) are a cryptic species inhabiting the pinon-juniper woodlands of the southwestern United States and much of Mexico. Little is known about Montezuma quail population demography and life history, but precipitation and its timing are likely key factors driving Montezuma quail reproduction. In the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, this species is potentially vulnerable to environmental catastrophes, such as the extreme winter events experienced in early 2021, but the implications of such events on their demography are not known. Winter events are known to contribute to over-winter mortality in other quail species, such as northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), but these concepts have yet been extended to evaluate Montezuma quail winter mortalities. Recent work suggests that such events may induce tail-specific correlation structures among demographic rates, though most models treat them as independent. Neglecting such correlations may lead to grossly erroneous predictions of population outcomes. We created a stochastic 3-stage Lefkovich matrix population model (MPM) to examine the effects of population parameter correlations on predicted population outcomes, local abundances, and extinction probability of Montezuma quail populations. We found that stabilizing dynamics were possible when demographic rates were independent, but destabilizing dynamics, which may lead to local extirpations, when tail-specific correlations were considered. This suggests extreme weather events prevent stage-related rescue effects and may destabilize Montezuma quail populations.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
88,Avian Community Response to Thinning Prescriptions in Pinyon-juniper Woodlands,"Pinyon-juniper woodlands are an extensive vegetation community found throughout the western United States. Stand characteristics of these woodlands have been impacted by climate, land use practices, and intense fire suppression, causing rapid encroachment of woody plants into grasslands. In New Mexico, efforts are ongoing to restore the pinyon-juniper woodlands to a historic stand structure and reduce fuel loads. As the vegetation community changes, so will avian communities. Of concern are the number of avian species that specialize on pinyon-juniper woodlands. Therefore, we have partnered with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to study how avian community composition changes in concert with changes to the vegetation community following thinning. We conducted point count surveys during the breeding seasons of 2018 - 2021 among plots thinned by fire and mechanical treatments and among untreated plots at the Fort Stanton-Snowy River National Conservation Area in Lincoln County, New Mexico. We are supplementing surveys with survival and site fidelity studies of juniper titmice (Baeolophus ridgwayi) and gray flycatchers (Empidonax wrightii), two species dependent on pinyon-juniper but with different foraging and nesting habits. Our goal is to estimate and compare abundances of key species among treated and untreated plots and evaluate the influence of woodland management on avian community structure. This project is ongoing as the first component of a longer study to understand time-lags associated with both avian and vegetation response to landscape level management actions. Understanding Flexibility of Habitat Use by an Apparent Short-grass Specialist in The Texas Gulf Coastal Plain Tara L. Rodkey, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Bart M. Ballard, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Richard B. Lanctot, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Anchorage, AK, USA Abstract: Migratory shorebirds are one of the fastest declining groups of North American avifauna, suffering an estimated decline of 40% since 1970. An obligate grassland shorebird and long-distance, Arctic-breeding migrant, the buff-breasted sandpiper (Calidris subruficollis) has been identified as a flagship species for other grassland birds by the Arctic Migratory Bird Initiative and the Midcontinent Shorebird Conservation Initiative. A recent range- wide tracking study revealed that this species uses the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain during south and north migrations, with all but one of over 120 tracked birds stopping in the region. We will estimate habitat selection by the species at this critically important site by building a species distribution model using nested hierarchical resource selection analyses at two orders of selection and a random forest classification of Sentinel-2 imagery in concert with cropland data. To do this, we tracked 52 adult buff-breasted sandpipers in the region with GPS satellite devices during spring and fall migrations in 2021; 50 more birds will be tracked in the spring and fall of 2022. Tags were programmed to transmit 11 GPS locations each day per bird. Additionally, we visited the GPS locations within a 5-day window to obtain detailed habitat information, such as vegetation height, that could not be verified reliably from images. Because of their small declining population and their apparent reliance on short stature grassland habitats (e.g., turf farms), a greater understanding of the species reliance on novel habitats at this critical stopover site is imperative for effective conservation of the species.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
87,Mercury Contamination in Alligator Snapping Turtles of Texas,"Rivers and lakes throughout Texas have been contaminated by mercury (Hg), resulting in consumption advisories for fish that accumulate the teratogenic compound. Aquatic organisms are prone to Hg contamination because it is readily converted into a bioaccumulative form in aquatic ecosystems. Macrochelys temminckii (alligator snapping turtle) is an aquatic inhabitant of Texas that is proposed for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. Due to its high trophic position and longevity, it potentially faces high exposure to Hg, which could negatively affect populations through embryotoxicity. We sampled muscle from 82 individuals of the species across four major Texas watersheds, and analyzed their Hg concentrations using a direct Hg analyzer. Wet weight concentrations of Hg ranged between 0.033 mg/kg and 0.910 mg/kg, with an average of 0.297 mg/kg (SD ± 0.162 mg/kg). Muscle Hg concentrations correlated weakly with carapace length (r = 0.18), corroborating studies on related turtles that have indicated non-significant increase in Hg concentration with body size. Concentrations did vary by drainage. Results confirm that M. temminckii is assimilating mercury in Texas waters, and exhibits a range of concentrations similar to those observed in a close relative (Chelydra serpentina) in other states. Concentrations we observed are within the range of those that result in lowered reproductive success in C. serpentina, as well. Assuming Hg has similar effects on both species, exposure may be negatively affecting reproductive output in M. temminckii.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
130,Assessing the Prevalence and Severity of Sarcoptic Mange on Coyotes in South Texas,"Sarcoptic mange is a skin disease caused by tiny mites that affects over 100 species of domestic and wild animals. The mites, Sarcoptes scabiei, are transmitted through either direct or indirect contact with an infected host. A female mite will burrow into the skin of the host and lay eggs inside the skin, causing itchiness. Clinical signs of mange include hair loss, thickening of skin, skin lesions, and infections. Coyotes (Canis latrans) are susceptible to sarcoptic mange infections. In this study, we assessed the prevalence and severity of sarcoptic mange in coyotes on 3 separate ranches in Cameron County, Texas from January 2019 to October 2020. We examined photos of coyotes from 140 remote cameras set up at fence crossing locations. Through examining the camera footage, it is clear that coyotes frequent these fence crossings. We measured the level of severity of mange by assessing body condition. We ranked all coyote photos from 0-3. A “0” showed no signs of infection, hair loss or scabs. A “1” displayed early signs of infection with some hair loss around the tail and bottom area of the animal. A “2” described animals with moderate hair loss or scabbing, covering 30-50% of the animal’s surface area. A “3” showed severe signs of infection including 51-100% of hair loss, signs of emaciation, and severe skin scabbing. Assessing the prevalence of sarcoptic mange is important for livestock and other wildlife as the disease impacts the quality of harvest from the animals. Effects of Road Mortality Mitigation Structures on Rodent Community Composition, Rodent Activity, and Predator-prey Dynamics in South Texas Adam Sanjar, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA Kevin Ryer, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA John H. Young, Texas Department of Transportation, Austin, TX, USA Richard J. Kline, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, TX, USA Abstract: Due to consistent road mortalities of federally endangered ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) in south Texas, wildlife crossing structures (WCS), wildlife guards (WG), and exclusionary/guide fences were constructed along State Highway 100 and Farm-to-Market Road 106 with the intention of mitigating wildlife road mortalities and reducing habitat fragmentation. The effects of road mortality mitigation structures on rodent activity and rodent community composition is not fully understood, both on the regional scale of south Texas and in the broader field of road ecology. This is primarily due to the low conservation priority of most rodent species and the difficulty of noninvasively surveying for rodents effectively. In this study we evaluate whether rodent communities observed around road mortality mitigation structures are different from those observed at habitat and exclusionary fence reference sites. Data was gathered using small mammal photo booths deployed at WCS, WG, mitigation fencing, and habitat reference sites. The collected data was analyzed utilizing a PERMANOVA test to determine if significant differences in rodent communities and activity exist between site categories while accounting for other factors. This research contributes to furthering the understanding of rodent road ecology, and may also have implications for how rodent predators, including ocelot, interact with WCSs and WGs.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
123,The Effects of Urban Heat Islands on Northeast Texas Anurans,"Amphibians are a vulnerable group that has been in decline for decades. Many ectotherms including anurans are affected by the environment around them. In a comfortable temperature, anurans can be found to be active. The presence of urban heat islands could have an effect on anuran populations present. We have been capturing anuran species at 3 different locations using drift fences and pitfall and funnel traps. Captured specimens are measured by their snout-vent length (SVL). A record of both temperature and humidity is taken every 10 minutes with a data logger kept at each site. Night call surveys are conducted once a week between 10pm and 230am with each survey being given a rank between 0 and 4 to quantify activity. A total of 10 species have been captured between the three sites. The average SVL decreases in the more urban sites with a .36 cm difference between the most rural site and most urban. Nocturnal calling activity has been highest between the times of 23:30 and 00:59 both in average call level and occurrence. The site with the most might time activity in both call level and frequency is our sub-urban site. When activity is influenced by environmental conditions, changes in these conditions can lead to the differences between population activity. These changes could create rifts between populations on a temporal scale. Environmental conditions influence anuran activity and understanding the degree it of influence is important to anuran conservation as towns and cities grow and climate change progresses. Influence of Woody-plant Diversity and Invasive-grass Cover on Habitat Use of Scaled Quail in South Texas Tate Scott, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Alejandro Bazaldua, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Kristyn G. Stewart, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Fidel Hernández, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA David Kitner, Duval County Ranch, Freer, TX, USA Steve Scott, Duval County Ranch, Freer, TX, USA Abstract: Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) are an upland game bird species that has experienced significant population decline. In South Texas, scaled quail favor divers shrub communities with sparse understories. However, rangeland disturbances such as root plowing, cattle grazing, and other management practices have simplified woody-plant communities and allowed invasive grasses species to dominate. Such changes in vegetation composition and structure have reduced habitat for scaled quail in South Texas. The objective of our study was to identify the habitat-suitability bounds of scaled quail for woody-plant diversity and invasive grass cover. This study occurred on a private ranch in Duval County, Texas during November 2021-January 2022. We collected vegetation data at both used and available points (n &gt 20 points/type) along a woody-plant diversity and invasive-grass cover gradients ranging from low to high. We analyzed this data using continuous selection functions and logistic regression to identify habitat-suitability bounds of scaled quail for these vegetation metrics. Results from this study will help identify habitat preference of scaled quail in South Texas and provide valuable information for management of their habitat.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
92,The Effects of Investigator Disturbance on Nesting White-Tailed Hawks in South Texas,"The white-tailed hawk (Geranoaetus albicaudatus) is one of the least studied birds of prey. We initiated research in spring 2021 by placing nest cameras at active white-tailed hawk nests containing hatchlings throughout south Texas, including ranch properties of the East Foundation. Previous studies suggest that the white-tailed hawk is sensitive to nesting disturbance and will quickly flee when approached. Our study aims to quantify the nesting sensitivity and investigate the effects of research-induced disturbance of the white-tailed hawk during the breeding season in south Texas. While disturbance can be calculated using varying definitions, our methods measure disturbance by using the tolerance and reaction of the individual bird (Nisbet 2000) demonstrating flight off of the nest. We present other consequential results of nesting disturbance related to nesting health, our methods to create a buffer zone for nesting white-tailed hawks, as well as other preliminary findings from this disturbance study.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
129,How Long Do Native Grasses Remain Viable in the Seedbank?,"What are the benefits of seeding native grasses in rangelands? Seeding a diverse, locally-adapted, native grass mix contributes to wildlife forage and habitat. Also, native grasses, once established, can increase water infiltration, tolerate drought conditions, and decrease soil erosion. Because native grasses provide many benefits to rangeland landscapes, one may choose to take advantage of a recently disturbed system by seeding native grasses. In south Texas, a pipeline was recently installed, leaving the ground surface bare and susceptible to invasive grass encroachment. After the project was completed, we seeded a native grass mix composed of eleven species along the pipeline. Although seeding has shown to enhance recruitment of native grasses, we also want know the fate of native grass seeds in the soil by monitoring germination and viability over time. We selected grass species by three classes of successional stages and two morphology types; in total we are monitoring six different species. For each species one hundred homogeneous seeds were enclosed in a mesh envelope and buried at approximately 10 cm depth. We created 25 seed pouches for each species Five seed envelopes of each species were collected at 1, 2, 6, 9, and 12 months after burial. We found that seed coats without appendages had higher field germination success when compared to seed coats with appendages. Also, we found most native grasses reached peak field germination near six months after seeding.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
91,Parental Behavior and Time Budgets of Nesting White-tailed Hawks,"The white-tailed hawk (Geranoaetus albicaudatus) is one of North America’s least studied birds of prey. Our goal was to investigate their breeding ecology in spring 2021 by placing nest cameras at active white- tailed hawk nests containing hatchlings throughout south Texas and East Foundation ranch properties. Little is known about parental care in the white-tailed hawk during the breeding season and knowledge of parental behavior is needed for successful monitoring. Raptors are known for sexually divided parental roles covering specific activities such as females contributing more to nestling care and males providing more territory defense or hunting. Our study aims to describe the sexual differences in parental investment and behavioral time budgets of nesting white-tailed hawks. Analysis is ongoing and we will present our methods for a quantitative assessment of the parental behavior and the sex-specific pattern of variation in parental investment of nesting white-tailed hawks in south Texas during the 2021 breeding season. Are Undergraduate Wildlife Students Better Equipped Than Their Agricultural Peers in Managing A Complex Agro-ecological Conflict? Initial Results from a Dynamic Role-playing Simulation Benjamin L. Turner, Department of Agriculture, Agribusiness, and Environmental Science, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Lane Michna, Department of Agriculture, Agribusiness, and Environmental Science, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Kristyn G. Stewart, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Abstract: Ecosystem management problems in systems with both agricultural and natural environments (e.g., land conservation, watershed health, human-wildlife conflict) can be perplexing for many students due to the feedback-driven dynamics across natural and social spheres. Much research has found deficiencies in students’ abilities to reason about such complexity because their mental models tend to be simple, visual, or lack the interrelated characteristics needed to understand nonlinear change over time. To test how well students’ disciplinary education prepares them for complex problem-solving situations, we designed a role-playing simulation capable of evaluating student performance in a complex system. The simulation involves three stakeholder groups: irrigators, indigenous communities, and conservation NGO's, who must manage surface water allocations in an arid watershed over a 30-year period. The goal is to achieve above financial breakeven in the agricultural sector without collapsing a wildlife population dependent on the river source. Undergraduate students representing 2 departments, wildlife and range management (n = 20 students) and agricultural science (n = 12 students), played the game independently. Annual allocation decisions were recorded in real-time with the simulation. After gameplay, all students completed a questionnaire asking each to describe their strategic intentions behind the decisions they made. Results indicated that students prioritized low-leverage strategies in their respective domain (conservation or agriculture) and did not adequately explore strategies outside their domain that would yield higher leverage and therefore success. Further game play will allow testing alternative pedagogical interventions aimed at improving student reasoning and therefore performance in complex problem- solving situations. An Assessment of Fine Scale Microclimate Conditions in Purple Martin Artificial Housing and Its Influence on Nest Survival Lainey Taylor, Texas Tech University, LUBBOCK, TX, USA Ariana Rivera, Texas Tech University, LUBBOCK, TX, USA James D. Ray, Certified Wildlife Biologist (TWS), Canyon, TX, USA Blake A. Grisham, Texas Tech University, LUBBOCK, TX, USA Abstract: The eastern subspecies of Purple Martin (Progne subis subis) are almost entirely dependent on provisioned nesting. Raleigh et al. (2019) found no variation in nest survival across 7 styles of housing, but with projected climate change forecasts, an evaluation of the microclimate conditions within artificial housing is an important component for the declining species. The goal of this study was to assess microclimate conditions of artificial housing types and if microclimate conditions (i.e., temperature and vapor pressure deficit; hereafter VPD) influenced nest survival of eastern Purple Martins. We deployed ibuttons among 4 types of artificial houses, in an active Purple Martin colony, Canyon TX, 20 Feb-15 Jul 2020-2021. We monitored nest status on a weekly basis. We used a one-way Kuiper statistic to assess if temperature and VPD empirical distribution functions (EMP) were different and if they influenced nest survival. We collected >500,000 temperature and VPD measurements among 40 purple martin nests, and our major findings were 1) EMPs varied by all factors, 2) Chirpy™ houses and artificial gourds had more favorable microclimates, 3) EMPs in metal boxes had the highest standard errors whereas wood boxes had the lowest standard errors, 4) microclimate was a marginal predictor of nest survival and 5) nest survival was >88%. Our preliminary data suggested Chirpy™ houses and artificial gourds may be beneficial for the species in 1) areas in hot, dry climates found on the periphery of their distribution 2) extreme weather events and 3) the future, given climate change forecasts. Comparing Acoustic Detection and Thermal Imaging for Wind Energy Tier 3 Bat Risk Assessments Robert Tyler, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA Sarah Fritts, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas, United States Sara Weaver, Bowman Consulting, San Marcos, TX, USA Brogan Morton, Wildlife Imaging Systems LLC, Hinesburg, VT, USA Nevin Durish, ESE Partners, Austin, TX, USA Abstract: In recent years, wind energy development has increased but not without unintended environmental impacts, such as high bat fatality rates. Current pre-construction minimization strategies monitor bat acoustic activity at potential wind energy facilities to predict fatality and improve siting. However, there is high variation between pre-construction models and post-construction fatalities, reducing reliability. Thus, new methodologies need investigating to maximize investments and predictivity. Our study focuses on using thermal cameras to supplement existing pre-construction acoustic surveys. Thermal cameras record the infrared radiation produced by bats, thus are ideal for nocturnal monitoring. Our objective is to determine if monitoring with thermal cameras provides improved accuracy to pre-construction bat activity estimates. Using AXIS Q1942-E thermal cameras, we are recording nightly bat activity in parallel with Song Meter 4 BAT-FS detectors at three sites under consideration for wind energy development using meteorological (MET) towers within the South Texas Plains. To monitor bats we mounted detector microphones 48 m above ground on each MET tower and positioned a camera 48 m from the tower, with its view centrally focused on the microphone. We are using Kaleidoscope Pro 5 to acoustically identify bats and a machine learning algorithm in Python 3.8.5 to distinguish bats from other thermal sources in the videos. We are using a generalized linear mixed-effects model to examine relationships between method-specific counts of bats and to determine relationships among seasonal and environmental covariates. Results have the potential to improve the accuracy of bat risk assessments and better inform wind farm siting.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
70,Difference in Reproduction Between Two Subspecies of Translocated Northern Bobwhite,"The gradual decline of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite) has resulted in remnant populations throughout their historic range. Translocation of bobwhite has emerged as a conservation tool to revitalize and augment existing populations. Despite success of previous efforts, our understanding of the effects of source population on translocation success is limited. Our objective was to compare reproduction between two source populations of bobwhite in Texas. In March 2019-2021, we translocated a total of 665 bobwhite from two different regions of Texas: northwest Texas (C.v. taylori, n = 253) and south Texas (C.v. texanus, n = 412) to a 1,011-ha private ranch in northcentral Texas within the geographic distribution of the northwest subspecies. We monitored 82 nests (2019: n = 9, 2020: n = 52, 2021: n = 21). We documented a difference in nest initiation rate between source populations (northwest: 0.83 nests/female, SE = 0.06, n = 53 females; south: 0.56 nests/female, SE = 0.08, n = 68 females). We estimated that hens from northwest Texas produced almost 50% more chicks per 100 hens than south Texas hens based on reproductive estimates. There was little difference in apparent nest success, clutch size, and egg hatchability. Based on our results, managers should be aware of potential reductions in reproductive effort for bobwhite sourced from a different subspecies. Mapping Dunes Sagebrush Lizard Habitat Danielle K. Walkup, Natural Resource Institute, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA Bret A. Collier, School of Renewable Natural Resources, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA Kevin L.

Fitzgerald, Biodiversity Research and Teaching Collections, Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA Roel R. Lopez, Natural Resource Institute, Department of Rangeland, Wildlife and Fisheries Management, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA Abstract: The dunes sagebrush lizard (DSL; Sceloporus arenicolus) is a habitat specialist endemic to the Mescalero- Monahans shinnery-sands ecosystem of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, over which land-use practices have contributed to fragmentation and loss of habitat. We created a fine-scale, continuous habitat suitability model for the DSL in Texas to support conservation actions. We used generalized linear (GLM) and spatially weighted generalized additive models (GAM) to predict DSL occurrence. We included sand cover, shinnery oak cover, binned rugosity, and mean maximum rugosity as covariates. We replicated our model selection analysis and our spatial prediction analysis across a random sample of pseudo-absence data, then selected the best ranking model, defined as the model having the highest frequency being ranked first across 1,000 replications. Finally, we used the averaged prediction, from the replicated model prediction runs (n=1,000), as our estimate of occurrence for each grid cell. The highest-ranked model was the mean maximum rugosity and percent cover shinnery oak interaction model. The distribution of predicted occurrence captured Winkler County well in the GLM, but Andrews County had a lower predicted probability than expected. The GAM accounted for DSL spatial dynamics; thus, we see a higher occurrence probability in Andrews County and a much lower occurrence probability in Crane County compared to the GLM. The GLM is important for identifying areas of potential DSL habitat, allowing us to identify areas for future surveys. The GAM could determine areas for high-value conservation actions, such as protecting dune habitat from further development.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
139,"Activity Patterns of Ocelots, Bobcats, and Coyotes on Private Rangelands in South Texas","The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is endangered in the United States, occurring in low abundance across a limited distribution in southern Texas. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) are sympatric with ocelots in the region and are potential competitors due to overlap in body size and diet. Previous research has suggested these mesocarnivores co-occur without spatial exclusion on private rangelands, but further study is needed to assess temporal partitioning of space. To analyze diel activity of the three species, we used camera traps on two private ranches in Kenedy and Willacy counties from 2020 to 2021. Activity levels were quantified using circular kernel distributions based on the number and 24-hr timing of photo-detections, and coefficients of diel activity overlap were calculated. Bobcats and coyotes exhibited the highest degree of temporal overlap (0.870), while ocelots and coyotes demonstrated the least (0.675) and ocelots and bobcats showed moderate amounts (0.716) of temporal overlap of the species pairs. Bobcats showed greater nocturnal activity at camera stations without ocelot detections than at stations with ocelot detections, indicating a potential response to ocelot use of the site. These preliminary findings provide insight into apparent temporal niche partitioning between ocelots, bobcats, and coyotes in South Texas and how it might potentially mediate spatial coexistence on private rangelands. Nest Success and Habitat Selection Response Of Lesser Prairie-chicken To Grazing and Prescribed Burning Treatments Michael D. Whitson, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Blake A. Grisham, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Christian A. Hagen, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA Warren C. Conway, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA David A. Haukos, U.S. Geological Survey, Kansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA Carlos Villalobos, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA Abstract: The lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is an iconic endemic species of the North American Great Plains. Wildfire events and grazing by free-ranging herbivores historically directed plant community composition and created heterogeneous habitat mosaics at scales that met the annual lifecycle needs of lesser prairie-chickens (LEPC). Anthropogenic alteration of these natural disturbances through row-crop agricultural expansion, continuous domestic livestock grazing regimes, fire suppression, wind-energy development, hydrocarbon exploration, urban expansion, coupled with natural influences, such as invasive species encroachment and severe droughts, have contributed to fragment and degrade historic LEPC habitats. Severe declines of LEPC occupied range and population levels have increased the importance of improving habitat management efficacy and efficiency to optimize remaining available habitats and sustain existing populations. In eastern New Mexico, LEPC populations occupy the Sand Shinnery Oak (Quercus havardii) Prairie Ecoregion; dominant vegetation consists of sand shinnery oak, sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifola), and mixed- and shortgrass assemblages. While habitat selection and nesting success of LEPC in eastern New Mexico have been documented; vegetation community composition and LEPC response to variation in prescribed-fire and grazing regimes have not been quantified. We used GPS satellite telemetry transmitters to monitor nesting success and habitat selection response of 32 female LEPCs to 5 spring prescribed-fire and 2 post-fire grazing treatments performed 2016-2022. Additionally, quantification of plant community composition, invertebrate biomass and assemblages, and modeling of standing herbaceous biomass response to prescribed-fire treatments and post-fire grazing treatments are being conducted to further analyze LEPC habitat selection and nest success response.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
68,Correlates of Singing Phenology of a Declining Songbird: Implications for Monitoring Programs,"The Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) is a declining songbird of the southeastern United States and a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Texas. Although it has a distinct song and can be easily recognized by voice, little information exists on its singing phenology and therefore its detectability. Understanding the detectability of this species has important implications for conservation efforts and monitoring programs. We used autonomous recording units (ARUs, Wildlife Acoustics SM4s and Minis) to detect Bachman’s Sparrows singing behavior at nine sites of known occupancy in Angelina National Forest, Texas. ARUs remained on site from 7 February 2020 to 17 October 2021, recording 30 minutes daily during a three-hour window starting at sunrise. We scanned recordings for Bachman’s Sparrow singing detections at each site and recorded presence or absence of singing behavior for each day. In addition to recording Julian date, we collected wind speed, precipitation, and temperature data from the nearest weather station and averaged values across the three-hour window. Additionally, we calculated the proportion of sites with singing detections across Julian date to determine singing phenology. Infrequent singing began in mid-January, increased in regularity through March, and remained consistent until mid-September, when singing ceased. No singing was detected between mid-September and the following mid-January. Logistic regression suggested that Julian date had a stronger influence on singing behavior than environmental factors. These results indicate that Bachman’s Sparrow are best detected between March and August; monitoring efforts for the species should survey during these months to maximize detections.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
104,Bird-window Collisions Trends on a Central Texas University Campus,"Collisions with man-made structures are a direct source of bird mortality that affects multiple bird species. We examined the composition of bird species affected by window impacts from September 2020 through January 2022 on the Abilene Christian University (ACU) campus. We selected windows facing the four cardinal directions on five buildings around ACU. We collected bird carcasses through an adapted collection schedule, in which students searched and recorded found remains with the date and time. During Fall 2020, we scheduled collections for every morning Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from September through November. When collections resumed in Spring 2021 (January to April) we collected more intensively for a shorter period of time by picking a week in each month to collect every day, both in the morning and in the afternoon. With an increase of catch per unit effort, we decided to continue this method of collection in the Fall of 2021. A total of 43 carcasses of 13 different bird species were collected. Among those species, Nashville warblers (Leiothlypis ruficapilla) were only found from late September to early November. American Robins (Turdus migratorius), White- winged Doves (Zenaida asiatica), and Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura) are all-year-round residents that see a migratory peak in the winter. The American Robin is the only one that had an increase in impacts during that peak. We recognized seasonal shifts in the composition of birds that can be correlated to the known migration patterns. Due to the migration patterns, we are more able to predict impact frequency. Extreme Weather Effects on Butterflies--it’S Snow Laughing Matter Rebecca Zerlin, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, Texas, United States Sandra Rideout-Hanzak, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA David B. Wester, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Richard Patrock, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, Texas, United States Tyler Campbell, East Foundation, San Antonio, TX, USA Landon Schofield, East Foundation, San Antonio, TX, USA Juan Elissetche, Texas A&M University- Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Abstract: With climate change leading to more extreme weather occurrences such as droughts, extreme winter weather, and hurricanes, it is important to examine the impact that these events will have on flora and fauna in impacted areas. The changes in temperature and other weather events can lead to habitat being unsustainable for many species. In Texas, expected impacts of climate change include warmer summers, more extreme winter weather, coastal land loss coupled with increased inland flooding, and increased impact from hurricanes. Because of their relatively short lifecycles, arthropods are ideal species to examine for responses to extreme weather events. Our study, examining the effects of prescribed burning on butterfly populations in coastal South Texas, began in March 2020. Over the course of the study, our field site was directly hit by Hurricane Hanna in July 2020 and received extreme below-freezing temperatures during Winter Storm Uri in February 2020. Early results show there was no change in butterfly abundance from two months before Hurricane Hanna made landfall to two months post-landfall, but there is evidence for declines in butterfly abundance in the three months following Winter Storm Uri when compared to the same months in 2020. These results indicate a direct hit during summer by a Category 1 hurricane are not necessarily harmful to butterfly species along the southern Texas coast, but sustained temperatures well below winter low averages can result in reductions in butterfly abundance.",poster,Poster Session I,2022,NA
163,An Evaluation of Western Chicken Turtle Survey and Capture Methods in Texas,"The behaviors and activity season of the Western Chicken Turtle (WCT; Deirochelys reticularia miaria) are poorly understood in Texas. Though its distribution within the state is widespread, turtle assemblage studies conducted within the WCT’s Texas range have seldom documented presence. Past research suggests it is potentially rare in the state with a patchy distribution. There is a lack of formal protection for the subspecies and its habitat, and remaining habitat is under threat from increasing urbanization. For these reasons, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a 90-day finding that states listing the subspecies as threatened or endangered may be warranted. Here, we recommend an ideal survey season for the WCT in Texas, review survey techniques from the literature, evaluate nine methods implemented in the state between 2015 and 2019, and recommend potential trap improvements for testing. Capture recommendations are inconsistent species-wide in prior publications, with bait attraction and basking behaviors being key points of contention. In our field study, we tested road surveys, spotting scope/binocular surveys, dip net surveys, seine surveys, baited hoop nets, two types of unbaited fyke net, and camera traps. Fyke nets and wading surveys yielded the highest number of captures per person- hour, while camera traps provided the most efficient visual detection method. Utilizing proper survey protocols and understanding the activity season are crucial for performing effective studies on this subspecies. Butcherbirds in the Ballfield - Monitoring Urban Loggerhead Shrike Nests Through Community Science Anna Matthews, Oaks and Prairies Joint Venture, American Bird Conservancy, San Marcos, TX, USA Tania Homayoun, Texas Nature Trackers, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Austin, TX, USA James Giocomo, American Bird Conservancy, Durand, IL, USA R. Craig Hensley, Texas Nature Trackers, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Boerne, TX, USA Abstract: Recent research suggests North America has lost 3 billion birds since 1970, with some of the steepest declines occurring in grassland birds such as the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus). This predatory songbird has declined 76% across its range and is a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Texas, which hosts 6% of North America’s breeding shrikes and 22% of wintering shrikes. Currently, we understand little about drivers of shrike declines, and a range-wide coordinated effort is needed to evaluate nesting and productivity. In Central Texas, Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Oaks and Prairies Joint Venture have partnered to study a population of shrikes that inhabit year-round and breed within Old Settlers Park, a public park in Round Rock, TX that is subject to intensive recreational use. This location is ideal for collecting valuable information about productivity and also presents an opportunity to involve community scientists in a project that integrates into larger-scale coordinated research and monitoring. The Urban Loggerhead Shrike Nest Monitoring Project launched its pilot season in April 2021, during which 13 local volunteers engaged in protocol-driven nest monitoring via Esri’s Survey123 and Field Maps data collection apps. Of 35 shrike nests tracked, 37.1% fledged at least one bird, 42.9% failed, and the fate of 20% was undetermined. We hope lessons learned from this project will contribute to Loggerhead Shrike conservation efforts and that project protocols and survey form development may inform other coordinated efforts to involve community scientists in data collection for priority species.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
145,Seasonal Variation in Crop Damage of Wild Pigs (Sus Scrofa) In Northeast Texas,"Wild pigs are of concern to agriculture as they destroy crops and property during their foraging activity. Two common foraging methods for wild pigs are rooting for buried food sources, and trampling taller crops like corn and wheat. These foraging tactics cause extensive damage to crops and incurs costs to restore farm land. The purpose of this study is to analyze seasonal changes in crop damage among wild pigs in Northeast Texas. Crop damage data will be collected through the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography and analyzed with automated algorithms. The proximity to habitat types and resources of the study area will be collected while in the field and through UAV imagery. The data collected from the study sites will be used to determine the amount of damage sustained to crops by wild pigs depending on the season and proximity to forested areas, roads, crop edges, crop height, and water sources. Information can be used to analyze seasonal crop damage relative to crop availability, proximity to habitat types, and weather patterns. This information can be used to develop crop and wildlife management techniques to reduce crop destruction. Future research on the effectiveness of wild pig deterrents, and selective planting of crops based on proximity to wild pig habitats could be conducted using the same areas and methods.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
146,Scavenger Guild Diversity and Carrion Use During a Mass Mortality Event,"Carrion acts as an energetically low-cost nutrient source in the environment for variety of species across taxa. Through scavenging behavior, these species provide benefits to the ecosystem and human populations by removing decaying animal matter from the environment. A special case of carrion deposition is the occurrence of a mass mortality event, which may be due to extreme weather events, disease, or caused by human actions (e.g., wildlife management and eradication efforts). We examine scavenger guild diversity and factors influencing carrion discovery and consumption during a human-induced mass mortality event. We placed remote cameras at 28 carrion sites created by aerial shooting wild pig (Sus scrofa) at San Antonio Viejo Ranch in South Texas in Nov 2020 and May 2021. We recorded 1) the first species/taxa to discover carrion, 2) the first species/taxa to consume carrion, 3) time to carrion discovery, and 4) time to carrion consumption. We conducted regression analyses to determine environmental factors that influenced these variables. We recorded three mammal species and three bird species to first discover or consume carrion: bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), wild pig, black vulture (Coragyps atratus), crested caracara (Caracara cheriway), and turkey vulture (Cathartes aura). Scavengers took longer to discover and consume carrion as the distance to the nearest road increased and as the distance to the nearest water source decreased. We plan to continue data collection and further examine how environmental factors influence the time taken until carrion depletion, and relative activity at carrion sites by species. Tree Squirrel Occupancy in Burned and Unburned Pine-dominated Forest Stands on The Sam Houston National Forest Richard Schaefer, US Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Nacogdoches, TX, USA Howard Williamson, US Forest Service, Southern Research Station (retired), Nacogdoches, TX, USA Rusty Plair, US Forest Service, Region 8, New Waverly, TX, USA Adam Terry, US Forest Service, Region 8, Lufkin, TX, USA Nancy Koerth, US Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Nacogdoches, TX, USA Abstract: Eastern fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) and eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) have both declined in the southeastern United States as a result of forest clearance and alteration. Fox squirrels prefer more open forested habitats, historically maintained by wildfires, and may face increased competition from gray squirrels in fire-suppressed forest stands. We used camera trapping to determine occupancy for both species within burned and unburned mature, pine-dominated forest stands on the Sam Houston National Forest in southeastern Texas. We established 12 (6 burned, 6 unburned) 3x3 camera grids at randomly selected sites on the forest. Camera points were 100 m apart and cameras were activated for 8 consecutive days. Each point was baited with cracked pecans to increase detection probability. We used the program PRESENCE to determine the probability of occupancy (ψ) for both species at the grid and camera-point levels. Gray squirrels were detected at all six unburned grids (ψ = 1.0) and two burned grids (ψ = 0.33). At the camera point level, probability of occupancy for gray squirrels was still 1.0 at unburned grids and 0.36 at burned grids. Fox squirrels were detected at five of six burned grids (ψ = 0.83) and one of six unburned grids (ψ = 0.17). At the camera point level, probability of occupancy for fox squirrels was 0.84 at burned grids and 0.17 at unburned grids. These results suggest fire is important for maintaining the open forest conditions favored by eastern fox squirrels.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
148,Feasibility Of Using Scat in Population Studies of Texas Horned Lizards,"We tested the feasibility of using scat morphometrics to estimate age class ratios, body size, and population estimates for Texas horned lizards (Phrynosoma cornutum). Scats were collected daily for 6 days from 6 hatchling, 10 juvenile, and 10 adult horned lizards collected from southern Texas. Texas horned lizards were measured for snout-to-vent (SVL, mm) and categorized as either hatchling, juvenile, or adults based on previous literature. Scats were measured for length and width (mm) and placed in direct sunlight for 90 days, submerged in water for 2 days, and placed in typical summer weather conditions of southern Texas. Scat length and width increased as lizard size (i.e., snout-vent length) increased with each age class. Scat size of each age class of horned lizard was consistent between days. On average, horned lizards produced 1 scat/day, typically in the morning. Only hatchling and small juvenile horned lizards produced a second scat during a 24-hour period, which both scats from the same lizard were of similar sizes. Horned lizard scat did not shrink or swell in size or decay due to environmental conditions, at least during the 90-day experiment. Therefore, scat from Texas horned lizards reliably can be used to estimate population age class structure, body size, and population estimates.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
149,"Decline Of the American Bald Eagle on Lake Buchanan, Texas","Prior to 2015, midwinter survey numbers for American bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) at Lake Buchanan, Texas, averaged 13 individuals. Between 2015 and 2019, the surveys resulted in four eagles on average. Because the population has been strong in the past and habitat has changed negligibly during the population’s decline, we believe the cause of the decline is noise pollution caused by recreational boats and by firearms during waterfowl season. This is consistent with McGhee et al. (2019), who established noise tolerances for H. leucocephalus between frequencies of 2 kHz and 5.7 kHz at 80 decibels, as the average shotgun used in bird hunting produces a sound of 155 decibels (Ben Findley, 2018). It is believed that the location of the shots allows for sound to be amplified up the canyon walls and to roosting habitat where it exceeds the upper limits of eagle noise tolerance, effectively deterring them from the area. Two teams will conduct a sound study in H. leucocephalus roosting habitat outside of roosting season to determine sensitivity to shotgun noise. While one team discharges shotguns on the lake, another will measure sound levels near roosting habitat using a sound meter. The recorded ranges will be compared to the upper limits of H. leucocephalus tolerances to determine if sound meets the criteria as a deterrent. A Comparison of Surface Water Extraction Techniques to Identify Wetland Availability for Wintering Waterfowl in North America Eve M. Schrader, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Georgina R. Eccles, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, Texas, United States Emily D. Wells, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Humberto L. Perotto-Baldivieso, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Bart M. Ballard, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Abstract: Wetlands serve as important ecosystems of diversity and productivity, providing essential wintering habitat for numerous waterfowl species. Wetlands have experienced steep declines, therefore monitoring spatiotemporal changes in wetland availability is of importance for future waterfowl management efforts. Within the last decade, monitoring and mapping of wetlands have improved with the development of remote sensing techniques. Here, we assessed the performance of different techniques to identify wetlands. Our objectives were to: (1) Compare the performance of water indices and image classifications for two commonly used remote sensing platforms and (2) validate the accuracy of these techniques with the application of northern pintail (Anas acuta) GPS location data. Two study areas were selected from an ongoing northern pintail tracking study, the lower Texas Coast and Cibola National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona. Supervised classifications utilized five water indices, (1) Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), (2) Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), (3) WI2015, and (4 & 5) two Automated Water Extraction Indices (AWEISH and AWEINSH). Indices were classified into water or non-water. Unsupervised classifications were conducted, classifying in a binary system (water and non-water). GPS location data of northern pintails were used to assess the accuracy of resulting imagery. The performance of each method in quantifying the amount and distribution of water was assessed with a confusion matrix and Kappa statistic. This project will help select the approach that provides the best precision to quantify the spatial distribution of wetlands in Texas and Arizona that can aid in monitoring wetland availability for wintering waterfowl.

Page, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Willis Sontheimer, Texas Military Department, Austin, TX, USA Abstract: Managing and identifying ideal habitat is crucial for species management. Habitat suitability models can help quantify the amount and spatial distribution of land cover that provides food, water, and cover for a specific species. The goal of this study is to develop habitat suitability models for Rio Grande wild turkey on two sites, Camp Swift (Post Oak Savannah ecoregion), and Camp Bowie (Cross Timbers ecoregion). Our specific goals are to: 1) develop habitat suitability models that the Texas Military Department can use to determine which habitats are ideal for harboring turkey; 2) cross-validate survey methods with habitat suitability models to determine the most precise survey method. For each site, models will be developed to identify food, water, and cover types for turkey. We used high-resolution satellite imagery and classified them into 5 cover types: woody, water, herbaceous, bare ground, and infrastructure. We are using a moving window analysis to quantify landscape metrics that describe turkey habitat: woody cover patch density, mean patch area, edge density, and percent cover. The landscape metrics will be then classified as either 1, suitable areas for turkey habitat, or 0, not suitable areas for turkey habitat. Once we have food, water, and cover suitability models, we will combine them to show an overall habitat suitability model for Rio Grande wild turkeys. The model will be validated using field GPS points. Results from road and roost surveys conducted in the winter season will be compared to the habitat suitability models and model precision will be assessed.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
152,Rx Burn Trailers in Texas,"Prescribed (Rx) fire can be one of the most cost-efficient and ecologically beneficial tools within our stewardship toolbox; but for those with limited Rx fire knowledge or experience, it can also be one of the most intimidating and least understood management tools. In addition to the need for properly preparing a Rx burn plan and constructing appropriate fire breaks, having access to adequate equipment and personnel to implement the burn plan can determine the difference between a successful and a detrimental Rx fire experience. Rx burn trailers (i.e., mobile units equipped with assorted equipment) are an available resource to many private landowners, managers, Prescribed Burn Association members, and conservation professionals across Texas. Contents of trailers can include any combination of personal protective gear, ignition tools, communication devices, suppression equipment, public awareness signage, etc. The entity responsible for maintenance and inventory of each trailer determines usage guidelines and costs. Rx burn trailers generally operate on a first-come, first-serve basis. This poster will showcase the Rx burn trailers we are aware of across Texas, their contents, and the points of contact for each, respectively. Ultimately, by knowing the details of available Rx burn trailers, we will all be able to better equip ourselves, and each other, with necessary tools for safely and effectively implementing Rx fire for the stewardship and conservation of our natural resources.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
153,Monitoring Arthropod Biodiversity in Erath County Agriculture Fields,"Arthropods make up approximately 84 percent of all described species, and contribute to efforts in pollination, decomposition, pest control, and a major food resource for other species of wildlife. Recent long- term studies have shown arthropod populations in decline and an ‘Insect Apocalypse’ has been of concern with an estimated 82 percent decline in flying insects over the last 27 years alone. Due to the concern of arthropod decline more research is needed to monitor long-term changes in arthropod communities at local scales. There is little research done investigating arthropod community diversity in Erath County, Texas, with the exception of agriculture and veterinary pests. The purpose of this project is to establish a long-term monitoring plant measuring arthropod biodiversity in Erath County and serve as baseline data for further research and natural history. This project will specifically address the relationship between arthropods and vegetation present in agricultural fields. For sampling ground-dwelling arthropods, we set a series of pit-fall traps along 8, 30-meter transects at 5-meter intervals (6 pitfalls/transect). We sampled vegetation at the beginning, middle, and end of each transect using Daubenmire frames to measure cover class and height for each plant species or cover type. We will analyze relationships between arthropod richness per unit effort and plant species richness, as well as measurements of community diversity and evenness among arthropods and plants. We hope our findings will enhance natural history records and contribute to management decisions on maintaining biodiversity on agricultural landscapes.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
154,Abundance Of Rio Grande Wild Turkey in Central Texas,"Rio Grande Wild Turkey (Meleagris intermedia) populations across the state have been on decline. Currently, there is a need for precise methods to survey Rio Grande Wild Turkey populations, particularly where abundance seems to be low. Therefore, the goal of our research is to evaluate the use of camera-traps to estimate Rio Grande wild turkey occupancy. We are conducting this study on the Camp Swift Training Center in Bastrop, Texas (Post Oak Savannah Ecoregion) and the Camp Bowie Training Center in Brownwood, Texas (Cross Timbers ecoregion). The study areas are 21,043 ha (Camp Swift) and 884 ha (Camp Bowie). We placed four camera-traps (each composed of two cameras) per average wild turkey home range (12 km^2). We collected data for each camera-trap between November 2020 and March 2021. We are currently sorting the imagery for individual detections. Once we complete the selection, we will create a database with: locations, observed date and time, and number of individuals; and we will pool this data weekly. We will then develop a spatially explicit occupancy model. We believe this information will provide additional opportunities to generate estimates for population density in areas where estimates are considered low. We hope to have a better understanding of what actions will be needed in order to better conserve and manage the Rio Grande Turkey in these two ecoregions.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
155,Trait-isotope Relationships of Snakes in East Texas Pine Forests,"Body size is often considered an important determinant of resource use in a species. Therefore, it may also contribute to how food webs are structured as predators may shift their resource use during ontogeny. However, few studies have explored the isotopic niches of snakes in the context of their functional traits, especially within disturbance-prone pine forests. Here we examine the relationships between body size and trophic position within snake assemblages in two pine forests under different management regimes. To capture snakes, we deployed 10 box traps in each treatment during the summer months from 2018-2020, measuring snout-to-vent length (SVL) and body mass upon capture. Stable isotope analysis, based on the isotopic values of basal resources and scale clippings, was then used to obtain values of δ13C and δ15N and estimate trophic position of individuals. Performing regression analyses, we observed that trophic position generally increased with body size. However, the strength of this relationship was dependent on species foraging modes and habitat use. Describing the isotopic niches of species, couched within their functional traits, can provide insight on food- web structure, and in turn, affect ecosystem stability in managed systems.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
156,Assessing Texas Kangaroo Rat Habitat Management and Population Connectivity,"The Texas kangaroo rat (Dipodomys elator) is rare nocturnal species with a geographic distribution that spans across two ecoregions in north-central Texas: the Central Great Plains and the Southwest Tablelands. It has been listed as threatened in the state of Texas and petitioned for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. Historically, the Texas kangaroo rats geographic distribution encompassed only 11 counties in north central Texas and 2 counties in southern Oklahoma. However, due to habitat fragmentation from urbanization and conversion to agriculture, in conjunction with the disruption of the historic disturbance regimes, they are now found only within 5 counties in Texas. This significant reduction in their distribution could also be a result of a declining population. There are three important objectives we are hoping to address with this study to inform the conservation of this species. First, is to determine habitat use and dispersal distance of Texas kangaroo rats for both adults and juveniles. Second, we want to determine Texas kangaroo rat response to experimental vegetation manipulation using grazing and prescribed fire in an attempt to create suitable habitat. Third is to develop a functional connectivity model, using Circuitscape and related programs, that is informed by the first and second objectives as well as expert opinion in order to identify potential choke points, stepping- stones, and areas of conservation importance to maintain population connectivity.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
157,Doves Slap the S**t Out of Each Other: Morphological Analysis of Weaponized Wings,"Aggressive wing-slapping behavior is commonly observed in both White-winged Doves (Zenaida asiatica; WWDO) and Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura; MODO). Many species with similar behaviors, including other Columbidae species, exhibit morphological weaponization of wings. These adaptations sometimes take the form of skeletal projections such as spurs or clubs. However, wing weaponization can be less obvious and may include increased bone thickness and density, as well as modification of the extensor process of the carpometacarpus at the tip of the wrist. Bone modification is predicted to be more pronounced in groups where competition and fighting are more common: males are expected to have greater weaponization than females, adults more than juveniles, and highly social species more than less social species. We studied size, shape, and density of wing bones in adults and juveniles of both sexes of the colonially breeding WWDO and the less social MODO. We collected linear measures of cleaned bones using photographs in ImageJ and standardized for individual body size with a linear measure of the tarsus bone. Additionally, we are processing multiple wings (n=5) from each category (age, sex, species) using a MicroCT scanner. With CT scans, we will analyze bone length with greater accuracy, as well as measure bone shape and density. Our findings will indicate whether these species have evolved modifications to their wing bones to support the substantial striking force that is likely to result from wing-slapping.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
158,Evaluating Use of Brush Canopy Cover at White-tailed Deer Birth Sites in South Texas,"Many abiotic and biotic factors surrounding birth site selection can influence white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawn survival and recruitment. As a part of a large-scale, long-term study seeking to understand white-tailed deer fawn mortality, we evaluated canopy cover at fawn birth sites on native rangelands on the East Foundation's San Antonio Viejo Ranch. The East Foundation does not permit predator control or deer hunting on the ranch. We determined birth sites from pregnant doe's fit with GPS collars and Vaginal Implant Transmitters. We paired known birth sites (n=40) with 2 random sites (n=80) and evaluated overhead canopy cover using a convex densitometer. We took readings at 4 cardinal directions at each point. Deer selected birth sites with 27% more canopy cover than available. Additionally, we will use a web application called the Rangeland Analysis Platform to compare estimates of brush canopy cover derived from remotely sensed data to our field data. This data will supplement a large-scale study seeking to understand fawn survival within complex semi-arid systems.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
159,Use Of Environmental DNA To Identify Semi-Aquatic Turtle Assemblages,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is genomic DNA from an organism found in environmental samples such as soil and water. As eDNA technology improves, the ability to monitor for difficult to detect organisms, especially elusive or endangered species, emerges without the need to physically handle individuals. Understanding the community of semi-aquatic turtles is logistically intensive when relying upon trapping, marking, and monitoring individual turtles across broad spatial and long-term scales. Analysis of eDNA extracted from water sources may provide a relatively quick and inexpensive method to investigate semi-aquatic turtle community assemblage; this method is also extendable to other aquatic vertebrate communities. The eDNA process involves using a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect and quantify the DNA specific to a species of interest. We will compare eDNA results from water sources to tissue samples from 7 different semi-aquatic turtle species to determine presence in a water source. Our study area is the McGillivray and Leona McKie Muse Wildlife Management area (789 ha) in Brown County, TX in the Cross Timbers ecoregion. Our focal species are Red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans), Yellow mud turtle (Kinosternon flavescens flavescens), Common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), Common musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus), Texas river cooter (Pseudemys texana), Spiny softshell (Apalone spinifera), and Pallid spiny softshell (Apalone spinifera pallida). This study will act as a proof of concept and validation of several outstanding questions on the use and reliability of eDNA, validating this methodology contributes to our ability to conserve and manage turtle species.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
160,Effectiveness Of Environmental DNA to Detect Ringtails,"Ringtails (Bassariscus astutus) are small, solitary terrestrial carnivores found across much of the southwestern United States extending into southern Mexico. Although not rare, their nocturnal habits combined with a proclivity for occupying rough, densely wooded terrain make them an elusive species even during targeted survey efforts. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is genomic DNA found in environmental samples (e.g., soil, water, sediment, and feces) that originates from an organism that encounters the environmental medium. The capability of eDNA is evolving to not only perform population genetics analyses on animals, but also extend presence- absence analysis to terrestrial vertebrates occurring upslope from a water source. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of using eDNA from water sources to detect ringtail presence and compare against detections from game cameras. During Jun-Aug 2021, we deployed 13 camera traps and collected 72 water samples from 13 sites across the Fawcett Wildlife Management Area (2,209 ha), Palo Pinto County, Texas in the Cross Timbers ecoregion. We selected camera placement to maximize likelihood of detection around water sample locations and we captured ringtails on 19 days over the study. Using a polymerase chain reaction assay, we will compare eDNA metabarcoding results from water samples to tissue samples of ringtail to identify presence in a watershed. We will then compare detection locations from cameras to detections in water samples. Successful results may provide a powerful tool for landowners to analyze biodiversity and researchers to survey for elusive species in a temporally and financially feasible manner.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
161,Soil Texture and Compaction Preferences of Captive Spot-Tailed Earless Lizards,"Plateau and Tamaulipan spot-tailed earless lizards (STEL; Holbrookia lacerata and H. subcaudalis, respectively) are seemingly rare species that are being considered for federal threatened status. Little is known about the habitat preferences for these two species. Past research believed the species’ used compacted clay soils; however, recent iNaturalist accounts find the species in sandier soil textures. Therefore, our objective was to experimentally test soil texture and soil compaction preferences of both the Plateau and Tamaulipan STEL. We captured 10 Plateau STEL and 10 Tamaulipan STEL from San Angelo and Bishop, Texas, respectively, and maintained them in captivity at CKWRI Wildlife Research Park. We constructed 3 interconnected 0.5 x 1 x 0.5- m plastic boxes, which contained 10 cm depth of sand, clay, and silt loam soils, respectively. Three experiments were conducted: 1) each soil texture was ground into a fine loose powder, 2) soils were exposed to environment for 2 weeks and allowed to naturally compact, and 3) each soil texture was compacted into a hard pan with a 50 kg iron weight. Individual STEL were randomly placed into 1 of the 3 interconnected boxes, allowed 24 hours to acclimate to their environment, after which the quantity of time spent on each soil was recorded on video. With powdery soils, STEL’s spent more time (P < 0.04) within silt loam soils; however, when soils were compacted naturally or mechanically, then STEL’s preferred sandy soil texture. Compacted soils only were used if cracks formed within the soil for STEL’s to hide.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
162,Modeling the Relative Effects of Water Availability on Blue Wildebeest: A Kalahari Case Study,"Numerous species of ungulates in semi-arid regions are facing the effects of rising temperatures and anthropogenic influences. Land managers have introduced artificial water sources and widespread fencing to the landscape and the complex implications of these changes are still being explored. This study focused on the Kalahari region of Botswana because it contains some of the largest remaining contiguous patches of savanna landscape and a unique transition has occurred in which previously migratory ungulates are now experiencing sedentary lives. Advancements in movement ecology theory were used to address the effects of anthropogenic and natural environmental factors on movement of an extremely water-dependent ungulate, blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), which experienced rapid population decline due to seasonal water supplies and the spread of fencing across the landscape. Movement data from 11 female wildebeest of different herds were collected between 2011 to 2014 and were used to better understand how access to water influenced movement, relative to other driving factors. Preliminary results from integrated step-selection functions suggest that wildebeest favoured shorter steps near waterholes (P=2e-16) and traversed longer distances when a water source failed. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the distance to fences factor did not significantly influence movement (P=0.376), indicating that wildebeest did not actively avoid areas near fences. Since wildebeest and other water dependent ungulates are crucial to the diets of various predators, large financial assets for landowners, and can potentially shape vegetation communities through grazing patterns, this research provides unique insight on how sedentary ungulates utilize the landscape.",poster,Poster Session II,2022,NA
1,From eradication to conservation: Identifying areas for restoration and,"By 1985, an estimated 400,000 square kilometers of shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) had been eliminated or degraded for agricultural purposes across its historic distribution. More recently, this clonal shrub has received increased conservation attention for its role as a keystone species in the southwestern United States. These trends, combined with challenges in propagation and establishment, indicate a need for targeted conservation and restoration efforts. Future climate models predict the Southern Great Plains will become one of the most climateimpacted ecoregions in North America, highlighting a need to understand the challenges dynamic climate conditions present for restoration efforts. Our objective was to identify areas for shinnery oak management and explore the role of climate in determining these areas when considering topoedaphic relationships. We constructed ecological niche models using MaxEnt to model potential shinnery oak distribution under current climate conditions and temporally transferred our model using global climate model scenarios to identify areas predicted to retain suitability through 2100. The current distribution model informed by environmental and topoedaphic variables performed well (AUC = 0.81) and indicated soil type as the primary influence on distribution. The second distribution model, built excluding topoedaphic variables to serve as the basis for estimating future plant-climate relationships, performed well (AUC =0.85), and identified increasing precipitation as snow as the leading constraint on environmental suitability. Future projections show stability of a core distribution located in north Texas and southwest Oklahoma. Our findings provide geographical context for implementation of conservation practices mindful of the uncertainty of future climatic conditions.",oral,NA,2023,1
2,Quantifying population trends and habitat for the chestnut-bellied scaled quail in,"Chestnut-bellied scaled quail (Callipepla squamata castanogastris; hereafter ‘scaled quail’) is an upland game bird that has experienced declines in abundance across its geographic distribution. Declines in the South Texas Plains were not as strong as in other regions until the 2000’s. Proposed hypotheses for the declines of scaled quail suggest rangeland deterioration and changes in land use. Major drivers of land use change in the region are oil/gas, urban development, and brush management practices that has altered vegetation landscape structure and composition. Our goal was to develop the baseline for a framework to identify conservation and management priorities for scaled quail habitat in the South Texas Plains. We first identified and quantified spatial trends in scaled quail abundance through population indices in the region. Our study area was in the South Texas Plains ecoregion with a focus on four counties: Jim Hogg, Starr, Zapata, and Webb. We used the Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) to evaluate changes in percent functional cover of vegetation categories between 1986 and 2020. Scaled quail numbers/route have decreased from 16 birds/route in the late 1970s to ~3 birds/route since 2011, an overall decline of over 80%. Data from the RAP shows percent tree cover has increased in all four counties. Field data confirmed that tree cover is linked to honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and the presence of invasive herbaceous species in the understory vegetation community. These factors suggest negative correlates of scaled quail habitat that potentially could decrease habitat connectivity.",oral,NA,2023,2
3,Effectiveness of Camera Traps and Infrared Trip Wire Position in Capturing,"Wildlife guards (WG) and wildlife crossing structures (WCS) have been installed on State Highway (SH) 100 and farm-to-market (FM) 106 to mitigate ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) mortalities in Cameron County, Texas. These structures have been monitored for mesocarnivores using camera traps as a non-invasive form of data collection. Camera traps are traditionally used for capturing medium to large mammals and few studies have assessed their success for monitoring smaller species. Our objective was to determine if a ground level infrared trip wire height at WCS and WG would capture small mammals and herpetofauna that may be missed by the standard infrared trip wire height set for mesocarnivores. We hypothesized that the ground level trip wire position would capture fewer medium-sized species and a greater number of small mammals and herpetofauna compared to the standard trip wire height. Reconyx HyperFire 2 cameras connected to external infrared trip wire systems were installed at two heights (standard and ground) on five WCS on FM 106 and five WG on SH 100. PERMANOVA identified differences in the species assemblages observed based on trip height at WCS (PWCS ≤ 0.001) but not at WG (PWG = 0.321). SIMPER analyses determined that rodents, birds, amphibians, and opossums were leading the dissimilarity between trip heights at WCS. A lower external infrared trip height would be beneficial to managers assessing WCS use by state or federally threatened rodents and herpetofauna, while not sacrificing monitoring efforts of mesocarnivores, such as the ocelot.",oral,NA,2023,3
4,Assessment of Non-breeding Bird Community Responses to Semi-arid Grassland,"Woody plant encroachment in Chihuahuan Desert grasslands degrades and changes suitable habitat into desert shrublands, contributing to the decline of grassland bird populations. We initiated this study to evaluate how non-breeding grassland birds respond to habitat restoration efforts, via herbicide treatments, in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas. We conducted bird and vegetation surveys on 3 ranches during the winters of 2019-2022. One of these properties was partially treated with a foliar herbicide in the fall of 2019 to control intrusive woody plants. We utilized a principal coordinate analysis to visualize patterns in non-breeding bird communities within and among grassland, untreated shrubland, and herbicide-treated shrubland habitats. We also related measured vegetation characteristics to variation within the bird abundance data through this analysis. Additionally, we ran a canonical analysis of principal coordinates to assess the distinctness of bird communities between the 3 habitat types. We found that non-breeding bird communities in the Trans-Pecos are largely shaped by shrub cover and shrub height: r = 0.697, p < 0.001 and r = 0.611, p < 0.001, respectively. We also found that bird community composition in treated shrubland habitat was distinct from the communities observed in grassland and untreated shrubland habitats. Herbicide can be a valuable tool for restoring semi-arid grassland habitat for some grassland-obligate species. By identifying the habitat characteristics that primarily influence non-breeding bird community composition, biologists can develop effective management strategies and set achievable conservation goals that benefit grassland bird species of concern.",oral,NA,2023,4
5,White-tailed Deer and Cattle Grazing – Nutritional Consequences for Deer,"Understanding the interactive effects of competition and environmental conditions on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) nutrition is important for monitoring population performance. It is suspected the competition between cattle (Bos taurus) and deer can reduce nutritional condition of deer, however environmental conditions may mediate this effect. We examined this interaction by linking metrics of nutritional condition (body mass, rump fat, antler scores) and reproduction (lactation status) of 475 male and 609 female white-tailed deer to cattle stocking rates and environmental conditions (percentage of sand in the soil, rainfall, herbaceous biomass, and brush cover). Deer were captured during October–November from 2017–2021 across four South Texas ranches. We fitted generalized linear mixed models to estimate the interactive effects of stocking rates and environmental conditions on white-tailed deer nutritional and reproductive metrics. Cattle stocking rates ranged between 0–0.2352 AU/ha/year. Stocking rates did not influence lactation status or body mass of males or females. Antler size decreased 1.67 cm for every 0.01 AU/ha/year increase in cattle stocking rates (β = -0.057; 85% CI: -0.111 to -0.001). Male rump fat also decreased with stocking rates, but the effect was influenced by environmental conditions; during dry years and in sandier soils, male deer had little rump fat regardless of stocking rates. These results indicate a sex-specific response in the nutritional consequence of white-tailed deer–cattle competition, as only male white-tailed deer nutritional metrics were negatively affected by cattle stocking rates, while female condition was largely driven by reproductive condition.",oral,NA,2023,5
6,Strategic Communication to Increase Willingness to Engage in ESC,"In the United States, landowner support for endangered species conservation (ESC) initiatives, such as Voluntary Incentive Programs (VIPs) determines their effectuality because private landowners own significant proportions of endangered species habitat. Problematically, landowner collaboration with bureaucratically driven ESC can be hindered by insufficient levels of human and social capital. Deficiencies in critical stewardship resources can produce break downs in communication between landowners and governing ESC institutions. This communicative gap has yet to be bridged by satisfactory investigations of how to communicate with landowners about ESC on private lands. We addressed this need with a quasi-experiment to uncover the impact of different messages on landowner attitudes and behavioral intention towards VIPs. We conducted a survey of landowners in east-central Texas to elicit their views of a VIP for the endangered Houston toad. Results from 956 landowners indicate that messages aligning with landowners’ values were associated with statistically significant and positive changes in ESC intention and attitudes. Moreover, results suggest that regardless of the experimental message received, information about the VIP is associated with positive changes in attitude and intention. These results highlight the need for governing ESC agencies to a.) strategically communicate VIP details and opportunities to landowners, and b.) tailor ESC messages to communicate ideological alignment with landowners to reach them at larger scales. Accomplishing these tasks can improve ESC outcomes at large scales and prove to be an irreplaceable, relational tool for collaborative ESC.

7,Evaluating the Viability of Translocating Northern Bobwhite as a means of,"Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) have experienced population reductions throughout their historic range over the past half-century according to multiple indices of abundance. This decline is often attributed in part to reductions in contiguous bobwhite habitat. To overcome the barriers of local dispersal caused by habitat fragmentation, managers often use translocation from areas of greater bobwhite abundance. Our purpose was to evaluate the survival, reproductive success, and dispersal patterns of wild translocated bobwhites on Gus Engeling Wildlife Management Area (GEWMA) to determine if re-establishment was possible. In the spring of 2021, a total of 75 bobwhite were translocated from South Texas to GEWMA, 43 of which had radio transmitters. Median spring-summer survival for translocated bobwhite was .77 (n = 43). We discovered 5 nests created by 4 different radio-collared females during the summer of 2021. Three of the nests were destroyed by either wild pigs or snakes, one nest was successfully hatched while the remaining nest was censored at the end of the study period. We also studied spatial covariates that influenced survival based on daily triangulation data. Sitefidelity was moderately high, however, 12 bobwhite were censored from the study due to either collar failure or detection failure caused by distance moved. During the summer of 2022, bobwhite cocks were heard on GEWMA, and coveys were flushed near the release site demonstrating the relative success of re-establishment. Future translocation projects should consider increasing survival of bobwhite during the first few weeks following translocation by utilizing soft-release methods or supplemental nutrition stations.",oral,NA,2023,7
8,"Population and Habitat Assessment of the California, Mountain, and Gambel's Quail","California has three species of quails: California quail (Callipepla californica), mountain quail (Oreortyx pictus), and Gambel’s quail (Callipepla gambelii). The human population in the state increased by more than 97% during the past half-century, leading to potential habitat loss for these species due to urban development, large-scale agriculture, and altered forest and rangeland management. We estimated the long-term population trends for quail species in California and quantified the effect of changes in land use and land cover to localized subpopulations. We used number of birds per route from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and interpolation in ArcGIS to create five-year rolling average abundance maps. We established random points and extracted number of birds detected from 1970 to 2017. We identified areas within the state that had declining, stable, and increasing quail abundances and compared road density, human population density, land use, and land cover. On the state-wide scale, populations of all 3 quails have remained stable over the past 50 years. Locally, sites where California quail populations declined had 64% higher road densities, 129% higher human population densities, and 93% less bare ground than sites where they were increasing. Where mountain quail were declining, irrigated land cover was higher by 154% but road density was 50% lower than where they were increasing. Increasing Gambel’s quail populations had lower human population density, road density, and percent bare ground cover. Our results indicate these species can persist in a human-dominated landscape if sufficient habitat is available.",oral,NA,2023,8
9,Influence of Rainfall and Vegetation Color on Northern Bobwhite Reproduction,"Quail populations in semiarid environments experience drastic fluctuations, which are strongly influenced by rainfall. Despite decades of research, the mechanisms driving this relationship are unknown. While past research has focused on the materialized effects of rainfall, we propose that rainfall itself, or closely associated factors, influence population dynamics by serving as reproductive cues. Rainfall events and-or vegetation color may provide supplemental information that stimulates quail reproduction in semiarid environments. Our study evaluates (1) vegetation color and (2) rainfall itself as reproductive cues for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) in semiarid rangelands. During April–August 2022, we housed northern bobwhite hens (n = 20 hens) in outdoor aviary cages that were assigned 1 of 4 vegetation color treatments: brown, green, switch, control (n = 5 hens/treatment). We collected blood every 2 weeks to measure changes in reproductive hormones and checked for eggs daily. We also recorded calling rate before and during rainfall to assess bobwhite behavior in response to rainfall. Although egglaying rate was numerically higher in the green and switch treatment throughout the experiment, egg-laying rate did not differ statistically among treatments (P > 0.05). However, calling rate approximately doubled from before rainfall to during rainfall. We will experimentally evaluate the influence of rainfall during April–August 2023.",oral,NA,2023,9
10,Distributional Responses of Northern Bobwhites to Hunting Pressure in South Texas,"Habitat selection and the localized distributions of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) are heavily influenced by the availability of usable space. However, the influence of harvest and associated hunting pressures on the selection of usable space is unknown. We analyzed the relationships between spatial aspects of bobwhite hunting variables among the changes in bobwhite distributions at 16-ha resolution during the hunting seasons in 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021. We calculated changes in bobwhite distributions using multitemporal density surface models from line transect distance sampling surveys and collected spatial attributes of hunting variables (i.e., harvest, hunts, gunshots) using GPS units on dogs and hunting vehicles. The annual harvest was 20% of the November bobwhite density estimate, with total gun hours ranging from 5.3-gun hours/100-ha to 8.3-gun hours/100-ha. We found that changes in bobwhite densities across hunting seasons were primarily influenced by year, indicating that bobwhite hunting pressures at low intensities have minimal influence on changes in bobwhite densities and distributions during the course of a hunting season. Coincidently, we found a significant negative relationship (r) between localized bobwhite density and each hunting parameter during the peak hunting period (i.e., mid-December to late January). We assume this relationship indicates that hunting pressure and harvest parameters at higher intensities will have a stronger influence on bobwhite distributional response.",oral,NA,2023,10
11,Habitat Selection of Scaled Quail Across a Gradient of Oil and Gas Development in,"The Permian Basin region of Texas supports a large portion of the oil and gas industry in the United States and is expected to expand in the future. The Permian Basin region is also home to a variety of wildlife, including the scaled quail (Callipepla squamata), whose distribution encompasses the entire basin. West Texas scaled quail populations have been in decline since the early 1960’s due to a combination of factors, including land use change, woody brush encroachment, overgrazing, and frequent drought conditions. Our goal was to determine if oil and gas development affects habitat selection and movement behavior of scaled quail in this region. We deployed global positioning system (GPS) transmitters recording GPS points every four hours on scaled quail across two ranches managed by ConocoPhillips in Upton County, Texas during the 2021 breeding season and 2021-2022 covey season. Scaled quail were captured on the Quail Ranch LLC, which acted as our control site and the Cross-L Ranch LLC, which acted as our developed site. An integrated step selection function was used to analyze our scaled quail location data. Environmental covariates included in our model were distance to well pads, distance to roads, distance to quail feeders, Landsat Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), slope, and aspect. By providing information on where scaled quail habitat selection and movement ecology on an oil and gas developed landscape, oil companies can implement strategies that mitigate the impacts of development on scaled quail populations.",oral,NA,2023,11
12,The Cost of Fragmentation: An Assessment of Habitat Connectivity for Northern,"Habitat loss and fragmentation are considered primary causes of species endangerment world-wide. For northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), habitat loss and fragmentation are considered ultimate factors influencing the species’ decline. Although bobwhite habitat needs are well known, life history knowledge is more relevant for management at a local scale but less so for addressing ultimate factors of the species’ decline, given that habitat loss and fragmentation operate at broad spatial scales. Effectively addressing the bobwhite decline therefore requires knowledge of bobwhite habitat amount and connectivity at large scales. In Texas, population abundance of bobwhites differs between northern and southern Texas, and it is hypothesized that differences in habitat connectivity between regions may be a reason. The objective of our study was to evaluate this hypothesis and quantify and compare bobwhite habitat amount, configuration, and connectivity between northern and southern Texas. We used 2019 National Land Cover Data (NLCD) imagery to develop a map of bobwhite habitat. Additionally, the NLCD imagery was used to create a cost raster for calculating the least-cost path of bobwhite movement. We used Program Conefor to estimate habitat connectivity with the least-cost paths using the equivalent connected area (EC). Here we report on metrics of bobwhite habitat configuration (e.g., percent of habitat, largest patch index, and mean patch area) and connectivity (EC) between southern and northern Texas in the context of contrasting bobwhite population trajectories. The findings from this study will provide a better understanding of the degree of fragmentation in bobwhite habitat in Conservation & Ecology of Mammals 1",oral,NA,2023,12
13,Influence of Traffic on use of Wildlife Crossing Structures by Bobcats and Coyotes in,"Wildlife crossing structures (WCS) provide wildlife safe passage, habitat connectivity, and positively impact movement, and their effectiveness can be impacted by placement, structure, and landscape attributes. Roads have a road-effect zone that influences wildlife behavior and survival, which can be expanded by increased traffic levels. Wildlife crossing structures can be negatively impacted by the road-effect zone, proximity of infrastructure and human presence. In Cameron County, the Texas Department of Transportation constructed nine wildlife crossing structures with non-continuous exclusion fencing on Farm-to-Market (FM) 106 and five WCS and 18 wildlife guards with continuous exclusion fencing on State Highway (SH) 100, to mitigate endangered ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) road mortalities. Our objectives were to: 1) determine if traffic noise influences use of WCS by target species; and 2) determine if traffic noise influences vigilant behaviors of bobcats (Lynx rufus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) at the WCS. WCS were monitored with camera trap arrays that consisted of four cameras on each side, with one camera taking videos. Noise levels were monitored with NSRT_mk3 sound level meters at each WCS. Generalized linear models were used to examine if there were associations between WCS use with traffic levels and noise levels, and to compare the percentage of time of behaviors with noise levels and vehicle presence. This study will contribute to the understanding of how traffic and noise influence the use of wildlife crossing structures by target species and behavior of wildlife in response to traffic noise.",oral,NA,2023,13
14,Strategic grassland conservation for swift foxes in multi-use landscapes,"Grasslands are among the most widely distributed, but most imperiled, biomes on Earth. North American grasslands once covered ~162 million ha prior to European colonization, but only ~30% of this landcover currently remains due to continued human-modified landscape changes. Strategic conservation of remaining grassland landcover, which considers speciesspecific habitat requirements, is critical for the persistence of grassland species and has become a global priority. Intact grassland landcover is critical for swift fox (Vulpes velox), a facultative prairie carnivore, and we sought to strategically identify areas where grassland conservation would most impact population persistence in an agro-prairie ecosystem. We modeled site (n = 381) occupancy by swift foxes using three years of camera-trap data (2018 – 2020) from western Kansas, USA, and integrated known-fate survival information to identify priority native grassland conservation areas. Additionally, we evaluated ownership of our identified priority conservation lands to determine strategies for conservation delivery. Our grassland assessment of two thresholds of predicted swift fox occupancy (≥ 0.09 [priority] and ≥ 0.18 [high priority]) identified 2,377,193 ha and 84,420 ha for conservation in Kansas, respectively. Identified conservation areas were overwhelmingly located on privately owned working lands (98% [priority and high priority]), rather than federal or state-owned lands (2% [priority and high priority]), and highlight the need for using conservation easements and incentive-based programs to promote grassland conservation to private landowners.",oral,NA,2023,14
15,Quantifying Degradation Rates of Environmental DNA (eDNA) of Ringtails,"Organisms release environmental DNA (eDNA) into the environment through shed skin and hair, bodily fluids, and feces. Prior studies conducting eDNA analysis from water samples have successfully detected aquatic, semi-aquatic, and mammalian DNA. However, many of these species directly use water and less is known about success rates of mammals not closely tied to water. Ringtails (Bassariscus astutus) are terrestrial carnivores that may have infrequent contact with water bodies because of low dietary need for free water. Our review of the literature revealed that little is known about the rate eDNA degrades in standing water. Thus, standing water may contain small quantities of ringtail DNA. Our objectives were to 1) evaluate the efficacy of using eDNA from water samples to detect the presence of ringtails in the watershed and 2) determine the decay rate of DNA from ringtail feces in naturally occurring water at different temperatures. We collected 72 water samples from 13 sites across the Roger R. Fawcett Wildlife Management Area (2,209 ha), Palo Pinto County, Texas in areas where ringtails were known to occur. However, we were not successful in detecting ringtail DNA from water samples. Our results suggest ringtail DNA from fecal samples can persist in a lake, pond, and creek water for ≥3 weeks at 10°C, 20°C, and 30°C. Our findings will improve sampling methodology for assessing biodiversity using eDNA and inform researchers of temporal constraints when sampling.",oral,NA,2023,15
16,Coyote Population Estimation in the Mojave Desert Region Using Noninvasive,"Since the mid-1900s, coyotes (Canis latrans) have expanded their geographic range throughout North America, due in part to anthropogenic influences. The Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) in Twentynine Palms, California has substantial residential zones, and densely populated barracks, where human-coyote conflicts regularly occur. MCAGCC is also intensely involved with the management and recovery of the threatened Agassiz’s desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii). Tortoise depredation by canids, most likely coyotes, continues to present wildlife-wildlife conflicts in other desert regions and has potential risks in the Mojave Desert as well. Similarly, no reliable coyote population estimates exist for MCAGCC, but these estimates are crucial for developing management actions for tortoises and coyotes. In 2021, we collected > 2500 canid scat samples at MCAGCC for use in noninvasive genetic sampling to develop spatially explicit mark-recapture population models using mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene amplification and microsatellite locus analysis. Species identification has been confirmed on approximately 150 samples, with a 96% accuracy rate on field identification. Individuals were identified using coyote specific primers and evaluating microsatellite genotypes. This research will inform us of coyote population size and connectivity, as well as their impacts upon tortoises – both of which will be useful for human and coyote management at and outside of MCAGCC.",oral,NA,2023,16
17,A Novel Approach to Assessing Texas Kangaroo Rat Habitat Use,"Very high frequency (VHF) radio tags have been used for decades to assess movement and habitat use questions. VHF tags are typically light and come with a longer battery life compared to similarly sized contemporary technology, but still they possess similar drawbacks. Additionally, they come with the added requirement that in order to collect data a researcher must be out there conducting telemetry to obtain location data. Alternatively, for a prohibitive cost you can deploy an automated radio telemetry system to collect location data continuously. In addition to VHF, Global positioning system technology has been utilized extensively for tracking and movement studies quantifying habitat use. However, the technological limitation for tag size and weight are amplified for this newer technology. Some of these constraints have been mitigated through the advent of solar rechargeable batteries allowing for smaller and lighter tags. However, these limitations are exacerbated for a burrowing nocturnal small mammal like the Texas kangaroo rat (Dipodomys elator). To address these limitations, we have developed a passive integrated transponder (PIT) antenna array system. This system will allow us to track the movements of Texas kangaroo rats within a one-hectare area with a 25-meter resolution continuously, without the need for active data collection by a researcher. This PIT antenna array system will be used to monitor Texas kangaroo rats over three separate one-hectare research plots to assess the impact of experimental vegetation manipulation conducted in an effort to create suitable habitat for this rare state threatened species.",oral,NA,2023,17
18,Behavior of wild pigs towards conspecific carcasses: Implications for disease,"Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species in the USA, and act as vectors for many pathogens. An emergent pathogen of concern is African swine fever (ASF), a deadly disease affecting swine that is endemic to Africa and has spread to other parts of the globe. ASF affects wild and domesticated pigs, and can be transmitted via several avenues, including interactions between and consumption of dead pigs by live conspecifics. As wild pigs are considered a threat in the transmission of ASF, understanding the behavior of wild pigs towards their dead conspecifics is imperative when considering the transmission of ASF and other diseases. We placed camera traps at wild pig carcasses dispatched during four aerial shooting events between November 2020 and June 2022 at East Foundation’s San Antonio Viejo Ranch, South Texas. We recorded visitations to carcasses by live wild pigs and recorded their behavior, and assessed daily carcass decomposition rates by visiting carcass sites without cameras. We found no evidence of cannibalism and recorded live wild pig visitations to only 33% of carcasses before advanced stages of decomposition were reached. Carcass decomposition was rapid, regardless of season, and the time to first visitation and investigation of carcasses by live conspecifics was quicker than has been recorded in Europe. We posit that active scavenger guilds at our study site, coupled with high temperatures, result in the rapid decomposition of wild pig carcasses which reduces opportunities for live wild pigs to interact with them when compared to milder climates.

19,Correlation Between Demographic Rates and the Influence of Catastrophic Weather,"Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae) are a cryptic species inhabiting the montane deserts of the southwestern United States and much of Mexico. Little is known about Montezuma quail population demography and life history, but precipitation is likely a key factor driving Montezuma quail reproduction during summer monsoon season. In the Texas TransPecos, this species is potentially vulnerable to environmental catastrophes, such as the extreme winter events experienced in early 2021, but the implications of such events on their demography is not known. Winter events are known to contribute to over-winter mortality in other quail species, such as northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) but these concepts have yet been extended to evaluate Montezuma quail winter mortalities. Recent work suggests that such events may induce tail-specific correlation structures among demographic rates, though most models treat them as independent. Neglecting such correlations may lead to grossly erroneous predictions of population outcomes. We created a stochastic 3-stage Lefkovich matrix population model (MPM) to examine the effects of population parameter correlations on predicted dynamics, local abundances, and extinction probability of Montezuma quail populations. We found that stabilizing dynamics were possible when demographic rates were independent, but destabilizing dynamics when tail-specific correlations were considered. This suggests extreme weather events prevent stage related rescue effects and may destabilize Montezuma quail populations.",oral,NA,2023,19
20,One Size Does Not Fit All: Species Composition of Wind Turbine Fatalities Varies by,"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) as endangered, has proposed designating the tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) as endangered, and the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) is currently under review for listing. Although white-nose syndrome (WNS) is the main driver of population declines, collision mortality at wind energy facilities could also influence population viability of these species. Western EcoSystems Technology (WEST) maintains the Renew database, containing data from hundreds of monitoring studies that can provide insights into the impacts of wind energy on these sensitive bat species. Using this database, we estimated the relative species composition across pre- and post-WNS time periods and by region. We supplemented these results with a case study from MidAmerican Energy Company’s Iowa projects. For all three species, estimated species composition was lower post-WNS compared to pre- with the magnitude of change consistent with observed population declines. Furthermore, species composition varied among regions pre-WNS, with subsequent changes post-WNS being greatest in the Northeast for northern long-eared and tricolored bats and in the Midwest for the little brown bat. At MidAmerican’s Iowa facilities, no northern long-eared bat was discovered postWNS and fatalities of little brown and tri-colored bats have also declined. Population modeling efforts should incorporate these new estimates of species composition that vary across regions. By doing so, we will improve our understanding of wind energy impacts on the future viability of these declining species and can more appropriately target mitigation to have the greatest effect.",oral,NA,2023,20
21,Sex Ratios of Mexican Free-tailed Bat Fatalities at Wind Energy Facilities for Local,"Wind-energy production has expanded due to interest in increasing energy production and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately, collisions and fatalities are unintended consequences of wind-energy production for many bat species. The Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) has a non-migratory population in California that has an assumed sex ratio of 50:50, as seen in other non-migratory bat species, and migratory sex-skewed (9:1 female:male) population in Texas that arrives in the summer to form maternal colonies. Knowing how males and females are impacted by collision mortality at wind turbines can provide insights into population-level effects. We determined the sex of bat carcasses discovered at wind turbines using DNA extracted from wing tissue samples collected during post-construction surveys in California (n = 502, 5 years) and Texas (n = 437, 3 years). Preliminary analysis of bats from California suggests that the sex ratio of fatalities did not differ significantly from 50:50 from 2016 to 2020 (p>0.05). In contrast in bats from Texas, the sex ratio of fatalities was significantly female-skewed in 2017 (6.8:3.2, z=3.25, p<0.001), became less female-skewed in 2018 (4.8:5.2) and 2021 (4.4:5.6), with neither 2018 nor 2021 being significantly different from 50:50 (p>0.05). This change in sex ratio in Texas might be demographically relevant if the loss of females from previous years is causing the migratory population to become less female-skewed over time. Studies of sex ratios at summer and winter colonies would allow determination of whether this same pattern is observed at the population level.",oral,NA,2023,21
22,Influence of Drought Conditions on Black-Capped Vireo (Vireo atricapalla) Nesting,"The Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) was delisted from the U.S. Endangered Species List by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 2018. As part of the USFWS Post-Delisting Monitoring Plan, nest searching and monitoring of vireo nests were completed in 2021 and 2022 to provide an estimate on parasitism and nest success in the region. Field work for this study took place in Kickapoo Caverns State Park in the Western Edwards Plateau. The two field seasons were characterized by mild drought conditions in 2021 and exceptional drought conditions in 2022. This led us to investigate the relationship between drought conditions and nesting activities of Black-capped Vireos. The logistic exposure method was used to quantify the relative success vireo nests had in each year. Nests found in 2021(n = 18) had a daily survival rate (DSR) of 0.96 and an overall chance of survival from nest building to fledging of 0.40. Nests found in 2022 (n = 15) had a DSR of 0.88 and an annual survival rate of 0.04. Additionally, we found in 2021 that vireos only nested in Ashe Juniper (Juniperus asheii) 16% (n = 3) of the time while in 2022 it was utilized in 46% (n = 7) of nests. This is of particular importance because juniper removal is one method used to help enhance potential Black-capped Vireo habitat. The results of this study will help inform management decisions for Black-capped Vireo populations as historic drought conditions likely become more common under changing global climates.",oral,NA,2023,22
23,The Rise and Fall of the Inca Dove in Texas,"The Inca Dove (Columbina inca) has undergone a well-documented range expansion northward starting in the 1980’s and 1990’s. However, it’s status in recent years is not well understood. As part of a larger study in Lubbock, Texas, I became aware of how rare the species has become locally and set out to investigate whether the recent decline in Lubbock was a local phenomenon or reflected in declines in other parts of its range. Using Christmas Bird Count (CBC) and Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data from 1970 to 2021, I found declines in abundances, not only on the fringes of the range, but also in some areas within the core of its traditional range. Additionally, it appears to have contracted its range somewhat since the northward expansion. Temperature and water availability have been proposed as checks on further northward range expansion, but minimum winter temperature and rainfall patterns do not appear to explain the declines seen in both CBC and BBS data. The causes of the patterns seen here are not clear, but may include competition from Eurasian Collared-Doves (Streptopelia decaocto), disease, water availability in urban areas, and social factors. Thus, while the Inca Dove expanded its range northward, it appears to be declining, both in abundance and range. Human Dimensions",oral,NA,2023,23
24,The Impacts of Bird City Texas on the Nature Engagement and Nature Relatedness,"Birds and their habitats are declining. Concomitantly, human populations in urban areas are growing and becoming increasingly disconnected from nature. Bird City Texas (BCT), a community-based certification program co-created by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and Audubon Texas, aims to promote both bird conservation and nature engagement in Texas. Whether BCT has achieved its goals of increasing public knowledge of bird conservation and environmental stewardship behavior has not been assessed. In addition, whether BCTcertification has influenced perceived availability of nature amenities, participation in naturebased recreation, and nature relatedness of residents of BCT cities is unknown. Our objectives were to examine whether residents of BCT-certified cities differ from residents of non-certified cities in their nature engagement (both nature-based recreation and environmental stewardship behavior), knowledge of birds and their conservation, perceived availability of nature amenities, and nature relatedness. We distributed surveys to residents of two BCT-certified cities and two cities not BCT-certified through door-to-door methods. Average scores of nature-based recreation activity and nature relatedness between BCT residents and non-BCT residents did not differ significantly (P > 0.05 for both constructs). However, average scores for perceived availability of nature amenities were significantly different between BCT and non-BCT residents (P < 0.05). Our study serves as a baseline evaluation of BCT and provides insight into the potential benefits of BCT-certification. Our results can be used to improve the program to enhance nature engagement and nature relatedness in urban areas.",oral,NA,2023,24
25,Mapping the soundscape of an exurban nature preserve,"All landscapes can be characterized by acoustic activity – known as the soundscape. Nearly all modern soundscapes are comprised of both natural and anthropogenic sounds. High levels of anthropogenic noise have been associated with avoidance and reduced success for many wildlife species. While urban areas are often characterized by high levels of anthropogenic noise, sound levels in exurban areas may be more variable spatially and temporally. This is especially true in areas with strong elevation gradients, such as those found in the Hill Country region of Central Texas. Wild Basin Wilderness Preserve is a 257-acre exurban preserve near Austin, Texas. The rolling preserve landscapes are bordered by a high use roadway, low density housing, and an adjacent conservation property. To quantify the fine-scale variability in the soundscape, we collected sound data from passive acoustic recorders placed at 149 locations across the preserve from mid-2020 through 2022. In addition to daily and monthly variation, this timeframe included the return to normal activity period following Covid-19 shelter in place regulations. We have produced a series of temporally and spatially explicit maps that visualize the soundscape variability found at the Wild Basin Wilderness Preserve. Our results reveal the existence of quiet acoustic microhabitats nested within a noisier landscape, which may be critical for the protection of native wildlife species found on the preserve. Future work will compare soundscape data with spatial patterns of wildlife presence and use to assess the potential value of different acoustic niches.",oral,NA,2023,25

Most of these interactions are quite benign and unremarkable outside of some potential excitement for an observer. However, in the urban ecosystem, some interactions with coyotes can be unpleasant or even distressing to the public. Conflicts can arise. In this presentation, we will provide narratives of two separate events in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Several incidents with coyotes and joggers in Frisco in 2018/2019 and one unfortunate attack from a coyote on a toddler in Dallas in 2022 will be discussed with full timelines of events. Different constituencies with various viewpoints will also be introduced. As urban wildlife biologists, we try to navigate these difficult situations, sometimes with unexpected results.

27,Stewardship ideology influences hunters’ acceptability of changes to alligator hunting,"Under the weight of unprecedented ecological change, outdated, irrelevant, or dysfunctional policies will need to be terminated. However, the process is made difficult and rare due to entrenched ways of governing. Promoting stewardship of wildlife within a democracy requires strong alignment with the ideological orientations of society. Hence, where hunting policies may be deemed unsustainable for large carnivore populations, an appeal to ideological dispositions, comprising ethics, frame of values, the role of science, and political identity, underpinning one’s policy stance could produce a less conflictual path to pursue termination. Few studies have explored the role of stewardship ideology, and none, to our knowledge, in the case of large carnivores. We tested a theoretical model of stewardship ideology to investigate the prospect of terminating the spring hunting season for the long-term benefit of Texas’s alligator population. A survey of 111 Texas alligator hunters revealed that the removal of the spring season would be generally unacceptable. However, modeling stewardship ideology suggests that a data-supported policy narrative that frames alligator stewardship in terms of how hunters can be better humans and hunters by reducing negative impacts to alligator populations, and doing so by playing a defender role, could advance the termination process. Further study of how stewardship ideology influences policy stance would fill critical gaps in theory and stimulate debate about how ideological dispositions can meet the current moment to usher in an era of policy experimentation in wildlife conservation that leads to a clearer account of large carnivore stewardship.",oral,NA,2023,27
28,Lessons Learned from the First 10 Years of the Oaks and Prairies Joint Venture's,"The Oaks and Prairies Joint Venture (OPJV) was formed in 2008 as a public-private partnership of agencies and organizations working across jurisdictional boundaries in portions of Texas and Oklahoma. The OPJV’s major focus is reversing declines of grassland bird populations by supporting strategic habitat conservation (biological planning, conservation design, conservation delivery, mission-based monitoring, and assumption-driven research) for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), grassland-obligate species, and their respective habitats. The OPJV geography is primarily private lands, requiring the efforts of private landowners to improve native grasslands management to conserve and restore grassland bird habitat. To accomplish this mission, the Grassland Restoration Incentive Program (GRIP) was created. Our objective for this paper is to document and share a decade of lessons learned in developing a partnership-based native grasslands conservation program to meet grassland bird conservation targets. This includes 9 lessons we feel are important in successfully designing and implementing a conservation program. Through designing simple, focused programs with staff that are dedicated to the mission and committed to constant improvement programs can be successful. Working together, OPJV partners have made significant progress toward meeting grassland bird habitat and population objectives, while tracking progress and improving conservation methods. Remembering these lessons and learning new ones will allow the OPJV to continue restoring native grassland habitat to improve grassland bird populations.

29,Alterations to Avian and Plant Community Structure in Response to Habitat,"Pinyon-juniper woodlands are a vast vegetation community that is vital to the western United States. Stand characteristics of these woodlands have been impacted by climate, land use practices, and intense fire suppression, causing rapid encroachment of woody plants into grasslands. Throughout New Mexico, efforts are ongoing to restore the pinyon-juniper woodlands to a historic stand structure and reduce fuel loads. There is a substantial number of avian pinyon-juniper specialists included on national and state lists of concern that may be impacted by these efforts. For example, the juniper titmouse (Baeolophus ridgwayi) prefers a mature stand structure of junipers that provide cavities for food storage and nesting. In contrast, the gray flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii) occupies pinyon-juniper woodlands, and in the northern extent of its range, it occupies open ponderosa pine forests with grasslands. As the vegetation community changes, so will avian communities. We have partnered with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to study how avian community composition changes in concert with changes to the vegetation community following thinning. We stratified our random sampling into thinned and unthinned plots and established abundance of key species based on detection probabilities. We conducted point count surveys during the breeding seasons of 2021 - 2022 at our study area in Lincoln County, NM. This project is ongoing as the first component of a longer study to understand time-lags associated with both avian and vegetation response to landscape level management actions.",oral,NA,2023,29
30,A luxury commodity crop drives habitat selection of a migratory grassland shorebird,"Migratory shorebirds are one of the fastest declining groups of North American avifauna. A recent range-wide tracking study identified the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain as a critical stopover area for the Buff-breasted Sandpiper (Calidris subruficollis), an obligate grassland shorebird and long-distance migrant. As conservation measures targeted at preserving habitat for this species are expected to also benefit a suite of other grassland birds, an understanding of what habitats are selected in this important migratory passage point is imperative. To study local movements and estimate habitat selection in the region, we tracked 52 (2021) and 37 (2022) adult Buff-breasted Sandpipers in Texas with GPS satellite devices during both spring and fall migrations. Devices were programmed to transmit 8–11 locations each day, providing an average of 10 days per bird. These data, in concert with the previous range-wide study, were used to perform resource selection analyses at two orders of selection using habitat covariates derived from USGS Cropland Data Layer and Sentinel-2 imagery. Results indicate significant selection for sod fields, with seasonal differences in resource selection. In the spring, when many crop fields were bare or in early growth stages, birds selected locations significantly closer to cotton than expected by random chance. However, in the fall, when cotton crops were leafed out, bird locations fell almost entirely in sod fields, with significant selection for locations with greater areas of sod. These results draw attention to a perhaps alarming reliance by the species on this specialized crop in a critical stopover region.",oral,NA,2023,30
31,Habitat Variables Associated with Scaled Quail Relative Abundance Across a Large,"Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) are constituents of the conservation crisis surrounding severe declines of North American grassland birds. Habitat loss is a major threat to grassland birds and may be a driver of scaled quail population decline, particularly at large spatial scales. A key step to determining whether habitat loss is driving species declines is identifying species-habitat associations. Accordingly, our objectives were to (1) identify habitat variables strongly associated with scaled quail relative abundance through exploratory data analysis, and (2) inferentially test identified patterns with independent data. To accomplish this, we collated over 20,000 scaled quail relative abundance records from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) roadside quail count surveys and the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) from 1985 to 2019. We related these data to remotely sensed land cover, land use, land change, and land configuration data across the range of scaled quail in Texas. We conducted exploratory and inferential analyses using the TPWD and BBS data, respectively, within generalized linear mixed-effects models. Species-habitat associations varied strongly by ecoregion. Thus, scaled quail management should be adapted at the ecoregion, or smaller, scales. Accordingly, scaled quail conservation may be promoted by managing landscape components found to be strongly associated with scaled quail relative abundance in each ecoregion. These results constitute a baseline for developing habitat management strategies to reverse the decline of scaled quail in Texas.",oral,NA,2023,31
32,An Assessment of Prescribed Grazing for Lesser Prairie-Chicken Habitat on Beef,"The Sand Shinnery Oak Prairie Ecoregion (SSOP) population of lesser prairiechickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus; LEPC) has recently been listed as endangered. Anthropogenic activities such as row-crop agricultural expansion, continuous domestic livestock grazing regimes, and fire suppression have reduced historic disturbance regimes and contributed to severe declines in LEPC occupied range and populations. An Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), managed by the Bureau of Land Management, encompasses ~17000 ha in the SSOP region of New Mexico where management focuses on LEPC habitat conservation under a multi-use mandate. Our goal is to assess the Bureau of Land Management’s prescribed grazing regimes for lesser prairie-chicken habitat and beef herd health and productivity during grazing treatments. Additionally, cattle movement, effects of water and supplemental feeding location, and habitat use are being quantified from data collected using GPS store on board collars on 5 cows to further analyze possible effects on LEPC habitat. Two pastures were grazed during the study, Crowley (4014 ha) and Old Savory (3092 ha). We quantified 1) standing herbaceous biomass (kg/ha) and 2) plant community composition pre- and post-grazing treatment at patch scale and in relation to water source locations, and 3) available grass nutrient composition and 4) fecal nutrient deposition with crude protein, total digestible nutrients, calcium, and phosphorus levels. ANOVA results show a significant difference (p<0.0001) in herbaceous biomass from pre- to one year post-grazing (64% in Crowley; 60% in Old Savory). Post-hoc comparisons show no significant difference (p>0.1) from the end of grazing to one year post-grazing.",oral,NA,2023,32
33,A Temporal Comparison of the Avian Community Dynamics Within a Riparian,"North American avifauna populations have experienced significant declines. Recent literature suggests a loss of nearly 3 billion birds with various root causes including habitat loss, climatic change, and unidentified factors. Temporal changes in breeding species community composition are critical parameters to evaluate the overall maintenance of biodiversity. We examined the temporal dynamics of a breeding avian community from summers of 2007, 2008, 2009, 2021, and 2022, and identified any occurrences of population shifts or trends. Our study area was a riparian deciduous forest along the Aransas River, on the Welder Wildlife Refuge, located in the Central Flyway migration corridor. Utilizing the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol, we collected primary and supplementary data to compare community dynamics, including the effective number of species (0D), rank abundance curves, and species composition. We found similar species diversity over the years. Results from the rank abundance curves revealed the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to be the most abundant species each year; however, this species exhibited a decrease in abundance yearly. We also observed shifts in the second and third most abundant species in all sample periods. We found significant differences (PERMANOVA, Pseudo-F=(4,45); p=0.001*) in community composition between historical and contemporary years. Similarity Percentage (SIMPER) analyses were performed to discriminate species contributing the greatest amount in overall dissimilarity between sample years (i.e., 2007- 2008, 2007-2009, 2007-2021). Our research reveals the decline in a generalist species, Northern Cardinal, indicating the need for further exploration to identify driving factors behind avian declines.",oral,NA,2023,33
34,Examination of habitat use by Laughing Gulls (Leucophaeus atricilla) in both,"Laughing Gulls (LAGU) (Leucophaeus atricilla) are native, year-round residents of the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. LAGU, like many gull species, feed on both natural and anthropogenic food sources. We examined existing observation data to determine where LAGU concentrated in the Lower Galveston Bay Watershed during breeding and non-breeding seasons. Bird presence data was obtained from citizen science platforms (eBird, iNaturalist). We ran an optimized hotspot analysis on shapefiles for both seasons. Hotspots in West Bay and the opening of Galveston Bay into the Gulf of Mexico were present in all years. In later years, hotspots occur around Baytown, the Brazos River delta, and wetlands on Brazoria NWR. In non-breeding seasons, populations were more dispersed, but still utilizing several of the breeding season sites. A GIS space time cube was created to analyze population trends over time. The west side of Galveston Bay and inland remained a persistent hotspot for reports. New hotspots were clustered to the west and north- indicating that more reports have occurred in recent years in these inner city and outer loop areas. This work indicated several broad conclusions: gulls clustered near major waterway intersections, some activity is related to landfills and parks, there were more reports to the west and north of the bay over time, and hotspots were shifting inland during nonbreeding months. Previous large-scale analyses in the Galveston Bay region have only used Texas Waterbird Society rookery surveys. Citizen science data offers a different view of LAGU habitat use across a rapidly urbanizing landscape. Conservation & Ecology of Mammals 2",oral,NA,2023,34
35,Modeling Pronghorn Behavior and Space Use: Habitat Selection of Translocated and,"Translocation is the most widely used tool to combat megafauna population declines to prevent extinction. However, despite widespread use, there are no explicit measures for translocation success. To alleviate this challenge, it is essential to understand factors influencing habitat selection of translocated individuals. To address this, we estimated the post-translocation habitat selection for translocated pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) based on patterns of animal space use. We postulated that translocated pronghorn would avoid fences and areas close to well pads and roads, because patterns of human landscape modification are a pervasive form of disturbance for ungulates across a range spatial scales, leading to increased mortality and stress induced risk-avoidance behaviors. In February 2019, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) collared 20 resident pronghorn on Rocker b Ranch, near Big Lake, Texas. In January 2020, TPWD translocated 115 pronghorn from Pampa, Texas, to the Rocker b Ranch, 45 of which were fitted with Global Positioning Systems collars. We fit integrated step selection function (iSSF) models for each individual. Our results did not support evidence of a distinguishing group effect between translocated and resident pronghorn selection. We found no evidence of a functional response based on our linear regression of well pad density within the 2year ranges of translocated and resident pronghorn against their well pad selection coefficient (β0=-1.16e–4, β1=5.60e–5, R2 = 0.03, p = 0.639). Further, these results suggest energy development and pronghorn overlap in areas of critical pronghorn habitat which has potential implications as energy development grows and inevitably reduces available habitat",oral,NA,2023,35
36,Examining Seasonal Movement Behavior of Pronghorn in the Texas Panhandle,"Understanding how individuals modulate behavior in response to interactions between life-history events and seasonal variation (e.g., temperature, resource availability) can inform management and knowledge of a species ecology. We used hidden Markov models to estimate behavioral states underlying movement from 72 collared pronghorn (Antilocapra americana; 36 males, 36 females) in the Texas Panhandle from 2017 – 2019. We assigned movements to one of three behavioral states: (i) encamped (short step lengths and high turning angles), (ii) foraging (intermediate steps lengths and high turning angles), and (iii) transiting, (long step lengths and low turning angles). We then calculated the mean proportion of steps of each behavioral state across individuals for four seasons representing discrete biological periods with varying physiological and/or resource demands. Seasons included rut, early horn sheath development, late horn sheath development, and rut preparation for males, and breeding, early gestation, late gestation, and lactation for females. Foraging constituted the highest proportion of steps for males and females at 60.5% ± 1 (SE) and 69% ± 0.9, respectively. Transiting constituted 29.3% ± 1.1 and 19.8% ± 0.9 of steps, followed by encamped at 10.2% ± 0.3 and 11.1% ± 0.3 for males and females, respectively. Foraging was most common during each season for both sexes but peaked during lactation for females. Our results suggest that there may be limited seasonal or sex-specific variation in movement behavior of pronghorn in the Texas Panhandle in spite of seasonal variation in life history requirements and resource availability.",oral,NA,2023,36
37,"Temporal Resource Partitioning of Desert Bighorn Sheep, Aoudad, and Mule Deer in","Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and exotic aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) inhabit the mountainous regions of the Trans Pecos. Biologists are concerned about resource competition in co-occupied landscapes, specifically between nonnative aoudad and Texas’ native ungulates. Arid regions like the Chihuahuan Desert receive little, highly seasonal rainfall, limiting the availability of water and vegetation resources. Ungulates use resources differently depending on seasonal activities (rutting, breeding, lambing, etc.). Limited resources, paired with cycles of ungulate use, may indicate temporal partitioning of resources among these three ungulate species. By examining these cycles through time, we will determine changes in resource importance and how ungulates may partition their use. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department deployed collars on 45 desert bighorn sheep (21 male, 24 female), 59 mule deer (34 male, 25 female), and 41 aoudad (33 male, 8 female) in the Van Horn Mountains from 2019 to 2020. We utilized data from these collars to inspect cyclic patterns in resource use of each species through time using autocorrelation surfaces. We examined cycles in distance to known water sources, and use of terrain ruggedness. Results did not show cycles in ungulates distance to water, showing water is not used daily with any regularity. Results do show daily cycles using rugged terrain in all ungulate species, with a seasonal shift during spring months in mule deer and aoudad. These results suggest that ungulates’ use of crucial habitats varies on daily and seasonal scales, providing an opportunity for temporal niche partitioning.",oral,NA,2023,37
38,Livestock Grazing Effects on Pronghorn Preferred Forbs During the Winter in the,"Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) is a native North American ungulate found in semi-arid landscapes. In the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, populations declined to less than 3,000 individuals in 2012 due to drought, disease, habitat degradation, and fragmentation. Since 2011, translocations and habitat improvements are implemented to mitigate pronghorn loss. As part of these efforts, cattle grazing may be manipulated to improve pronghorn habitat. However, the effects of grazing on winter forage conditions are not well understood. As forage nutrition, abundance, and diversity declines in the dry, cool season, investigating these changes in more detail can reveal limitations and deficiencies of forage available for pronghorn consumption. This study aims to compare vegetation production, species diversity, and nutritional quality in 3 cattle grazing systems during the cool season. This project was conducted on the Mimms Ranch in Presidio County, Texas. We sampled 100 plots in a continuously grazed system, 150 plots in a rotationally grazed system, and 5 plots within each of 10 non-grazed pastures under otherwise similar conditions. We identified and collected all above ground biomass of all non-woody forbs within a 1 m2 at each sampling point. We measured the acid detergent fiber (ADF) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) of winter 2021 vegetation samples. We ran a Redundancy Analysis to investigate the relationships between grazing systems and forb biomass, diversity, and energy contents. Understanding vegetation community response to livestock grazing systems may allow managers to adapt grazing practices to maximize the abundance and quality of winter forage for pronghorn.",oral,NA,2023,38
39,Modeling Pronghorn Behavior and Space Use: Fence Behavior of Translocated and,"Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are endemic North American ungulates that are thought to have cognitive maps of the landscape, and these memories could drive space use posttranslocation. Therefore, understanding challenges specific to pronghorn space use is critical for monitoring translocation success. Barriers like fences are responsible for the inhibition of movement, increased energy demands, reduced access to quality forage, impact injuries, mortalities, and separation from metapopulations. To address this, we examined the posttranslocation fence crossing behavior for translocated and resident pronghorn based on patterns of animal space use. We postulated that residents and translocated pronghorn would avoid fences, because patterns of human landscape modification are a pervasive form of disturbance for ungulates across a range spatial scales. In February 2019, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) collared 20 resident pronghorn on Rocker b Ranch, near Big Lake, Texas. In January 2020, TPWD translocated 115 pronghorn from Pampa, Texas, to the Rocker b Ranch, 45 of which were fitted with Global Positioning Systems collars. The ranch made 200 fence modifications prior to the arrival of translocated pronghorn. To investigate fence crossing behavior, we calculated the frequency and location of fence crossings among translocated and resident individuals. We found that translocated pronghorn cross multiple fences more frequently while residents tend to maintain pasture boundaries. Our results suggest that the naivety of the translocated pronghorn towards fences allows them to be more selective. Further, translocation may expedite the colonization of reconnected habitat following fence modification, conferring a previously unrecognized advantage of this practice.

40,Effects of Grazing by Bison on Arthropod and Vegetation Communities,"With enclosed populations, it is important to understand when the population reaches or exceeds carrying capacity. In 1997, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) relocated 36 southern plains bison (Bison bison bison) to Caprock Canyons State Park (CCSP), a 6,070- ha state park in Briscoe County, Texas. In 2015, park biologists, using the USDA Web Soil Survey, estimated that carrying capacity was approximately 250 individuals. Currently, there are roughly 350 head of bison in the park. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of bison grazing on vegetation and arthropods in the park. In 2018, TPWD established fenced areas to create grazing-exclusion plots. From 2020-2022, we conducted monthly surveys on the plant and arthropod communities in the grazed areas and grazing exclosures. We randomly sampled using 2 Daubenmire frames within the exclosure and 2 frames 30-m away in a random direction, which is accessible for grazing. Within each Daubenmire frame we estimated bare ground, litter, plant diversity, and plant height per species. We also surveyed for arthropods in the exclosure and grazed areas. Our results, indicate a trend towards higher relative cover of hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), in the exclosure than in grazed areas but no trend for little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) or western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya). Currently, we are analyzing other plant species and arthropods. CCSP can use this information to create a plan for managing the bison herd and the vegetation and arthropod communities in park.",oral,NA,2023,40
41,Comparing terrestrial wildlife diversity between native and non-native grassland,"Wildlife diversity is essential and valuable for the environment, society, and the economy. Grasslands have long been a biodiversity hotspot before human activity. Historically, grasslands comprised a large portion of the landscape in Texas. However, 99% of the native grasslands have been lost. Anthropogenic activity has significantly altered these grasslands through conversion to monoculture pastures, agriculture, invasive species introduction, and development. Conversion and degradation of native grasslands decrease biodiversity and decrease ecosystem functioning. Ecosystems services provided by diverse native grassland communities, including carbon sequestration, water quality and quantity, erosion control, and flood prevention, are monetarily valuable. Wildlife diversity benefits include an array of birds, insects, and bats that disperse seeds and provide pollination services, as well as game species such as quail, deer, and more. In this pilot study, we sought to determine a significant difference in the diversity of terrestrial wildlife taxa, including herpetofauna, birds, small mammals, bats, mesomammals, and invertebrates (insects, arachnids, and mollusks). We used a collection of sampling methods designed to evaluate species richness in a time and area constraint on nonnative grass-dominant and native grass-dominant study sites. We surveyed sites in May, July, and September of 2022. Evidence suggests an association between wildlife species diversity and dominant vegetation systems (P<0.0001). This research may be used to demonstrate the quantifiable advantages of restoring and preserving native grasslands.",oral,NA,2023,41
42,Mapping Prairie Quality at a Landscape Scale,"Prairies make up large parts of Texas’s ecoregions and are one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America. Prairies provide habitat for a diverse array of plant and animal species and are important for nutrient cycling, carbon storage, water quality, livestock, hunting, and other forms of outdoor recreation. The persistence of these ecosystems is threatened by urbanization, conversion to agriculture, fire suppression, exotic plant species, and loss of landscape-level processes. Further, the current condition of these landscapes remains widely unknown. The goal of this project was to systematically sample portions of the Blackland Prairies, Grand Prairie, Crosstimbers, and Coastal Prairies to determine, through field sampling, remote-sensing, and modeling, the distribution and quality of grasslands within these areas. Field data and photo interpretation points were used to remotely sense grassland quality in a pilot study area roughly 2 million acres in size. We targeted six different grassland classes for mapping: Grass Farm, Monoculture Hayfield, High Quality Prairie, Mostly Exotic Pasture, Mostly Native Pasture, and Old Field/Fallow Field. Overall map accuracy was 80% and three grassland classes were mapped with over 81% accuracy: High Quality Prairie, Monoculture Hayfield, and Mostly Exotic Pasture. High accuracy in our grassland quality mapping targets was achieved by increasing the amount of field data collected, using lidar-derived data, and increasing the resolution of satellite imagery. These results will assist with on-the-ground conservation and restoration of grasslands and grassland-dependent species.",oral,NA,2023,42
43,Grassland Effectiveness Monitoring: Results from Pilot Tests of a Tiered and,"Grasslands are an imperiled ecosystem in North America, with 2/3 of the historical distribution of this critical habitat lost. To counteract these declines, habitat restoration programs implement practices like brush management, prescribed fire, herbicide treatment, and prescribed grazing. About $2.8 million/year is spent implementing practices like these on private lands by U.S. Fish and Wildlife-Southwest Region’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife program, and millions more is spent by similar programs. However, little monitoring data is available to assess treatment success. The Grassland Effectiveness Monitoring (GEM) protocol was developed to fulfill this need and is designed to integrate with Bureau of Land Management and Natural Resources Conservation Service monitoring programs. It offers a simplified, tiered design that allows for differing plant identification skill levels while producing useful habitat assessment metrics. This protocol was tested on Grassland Restoration Incentive Program prescribed fire and brush management projects in the Blackland Prairie and Cross Timbers regions of Texas in 2021 and 2022. Both treatments typically produce early successional habitat. We tested the assumption that prescribed fire yields better quality grassland habitat. Preliminary results indicate that prescribed fire sites had more native herbaceous cover, which comprised ~35.5% of the site area as compared to ~19% of brush management sites. Additionally, mean woody height on brush management sites was 4.6 meters and 1.8 meters on fire sites. Pilot study results show that GEM can produce data to evaluate habitat treatment success, and its flexibility makes GEM a useful tool to apply across programs, facilitating pooled analyses.",oral,NA,2023,43
44,Asessing Ground-Dwelling Arthropod Biodiversity in Rangelands Under Differing,"Arthropods make up 84% of all described species and contribute significant ecosystem services such as pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control, and as a major food resource for other species of wildlife. Recent studies suggest long-term declines in arthropod population densities and biomass. However, the magnitude and extent of arthropod decline in North America is not well understood, prompting a need to facilitate biomonitoring at local scales to determine long-term changes in arthropod communities and identify mechanisms for declines. The purpose of this study is to establish long-term monitoring in rangelands in Erath County and report changes in the diversity and composition of arthropod communities associated with cattle grazing. We established 8, 30-m transects during Summer 2019 and 2022 at Tarleton State University Agricultural Center where collections occurred before and after grazing events. Within each transect we measured vegetation characteristics (species richness, horizontal cover, and plant height) using three Daubenmire frames and sampled ground-dwelling arthropods using 6 pitfall traps on a monthly basis. We identified arthropods to the family level and quantified family richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness within each transect. In areas associated with non-native vegetation we found high densities of non-native arthropods, notably pillbugs (Isopoda: Armadillidiidae) and ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). In 2019 diversity was similar, but abundance similarity was inconclusive. Our findings will enhance natural history records and contribute to management decisions on maintaining arthropod diversity in rangelands in NorthCentral Texas.",oral,NA,2023,44
45,Effect of juniper removal on ground-dwelling arthropod biodiversity,"Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) has increased exponentially across Texas. Encroachment of this dense evergreen influences community dynamics by suppressing understory growth and outcompeting other native vegetation, thus affecting arthropod assemblages. Arthropods play a critical role in the environment for their ecological processes. Our objectives are to evaluate ground-dwelling arthropod community richness, abundance, and composition in response to Ashe juniper removal in riparian areas. In October 2020, juniper removal occurred on a 182-ha property adjacent to Palo Pinto Mountains State Park in Stephens County, TX, to remove Ashe juniper as part of a habitat remediation project. Results of brush management efforts indicated a 43% reduction in total canopy cover. We surveyed from April to July 2021 and 2022 during peak arthropod production at non-juniper, juniper removed (and reseeding of herbaceous cover), and juniper present sites. We sampled a total of 54 sites 4 times during the season using pitfall traps and vacuum sampling. Additionally, we measured ground cover using Daubenmire frames since herbaceous, litter, and bare ground cover can influence the presence of certain arthropod taxa. One-year post-removal, we did not detect a difference in arthropods among the three site treatments. Two-years post-removal, we detect differences in ground cover among the treatments, such as juniper areas having lower heterogeneity in ground cover. We are currently finalizing arthropod data and additional analyses. By evaluating the impact of juniper removal on arthropod productivity, adaptive management strategies can be applied to better understand how other faunal communities may respond to juniper removal.

46,"Movement, home range size, and habitat use of Eastern Black-tailed Rattlesnakes","Despite its wide distribution throughout the northern Chihuahuan Desert, extraordinarily little is known about the ecology or behavior of Eastern Black-tailed Rattlesnakes (Crotalus ornatus). The primary literature for black-tailed rattlesnakes was largely based on research conducted on the former conspecific (C. molossus), thus the re-validation of C. ornatus widened the void in our understanding of the species. The aim of this study was to elucidate movement patterns, home range size, and habitat use by C. ornatus in the northern Chihuahuan Desert of far west Texas. Radiotelemetry was used to monitor individual snakes from May 2015 through August 2018. Mean home range size for all individuals was 22.84 ha and mean daily distance moved was 9.28 m/day. Male snakes had larger home range sizes (P=0.009), larger core use areas (P=0.02), and higher daily distance moved (P=0.001) than female snakes. Male movement peaked in August (P=0.004) and female movement was statistically similar throughout the active season. Multinomial logit models were used to analyze habitat use patterns of C. ornatus, while controlling for snake, habitat availability, and season. Despite low availability within snake home ranges, most observations of snakes occurred in arroyos or on rocky slopes (P<0.001). Microhabitat was also used non-randomly, with snakes seeking cover in rocky refugia or under dense vegetation (P<0.001), rather than areas containing high proportions of gravel or plant litter. This study presents the first detailed information about habitat and microhabitat use, along with patterns of movement and home range size for the recently revalidated C. ornatus.",oral,NA,2023,46
47,Habitat Conservation Forecasting for the Western Massasauga,"An understanding of past climate-driven changes in Western Massasauga (Sistrurus tergeminus) distribution can offer a perspective on how resources might best be allocated to achieve the greatest future conservation benefits for the lowest cost and therefore maximize return-on-investments. Past projections or hindcasting of species distribution models (SDMs) across the range of S. tergeminus through the Last Glacial Maximum more than 20,000 years ago when ice sheets were at their maximum extent showed dramatically decreased areas of suitable habitat in most of the US, but increased areas of suitable habitat in Mexico. As climate changed through the mid-Holocene 7,000 to 5,000 years ago to present day conditions, the distribution of S. tergeminus suitable habitat and populations expanded. Future projections or forecasts of SDMs across the range of S. tergeminus show a continued expansion and northward shift of suitable habitat by 2050 and 2070. These model results suggest that S. tergeminus was fully capable of tracking changes in the distribution of their habitat in response to past climate change. By extension, these results also suggest that S. tergeminus should be able to track changes in the distribution of their habitat in response to future climate change, if anthropogenic barriers to dispersal do not dominate future landscapes. As such, investing resources in landscape conservation strategies that focus on corridors and habitat linkages, rather than fixed boundaryprotected areas, should help preserve the connectivity of S. tergeminus populations under future climate change and therefore provide a better return-on-investment.",oral,NA,2023,47
48,Demography of reintroduced Louisiana Pinesnakes,"The Louisiana Pinesnake (Pituophis ruthveni) has exhibited drastic population declines resulting its listing as federally threatened under the Endangered Species Act. A captive population has been managed to produce head started individuals for release at a reintroduction site in the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana. Since 2010, releases of head started snakes have occurred annually where they have been monitored with a variety of passive techniques including box traps and automated PIT tag recorders. However, our current understanding of the demography of this reintroduced population is limited. The development of spatially explicit population models admits the spatial structure of the ecological processes that influence the encounter history data, as well as the spatial aspect of how the data was collected, and thus estimated density can be understood in the context of the sample area. The long-term monitoring of this reintroduced population enabled us to develop a spatially explicit population model to estimate density within the sample area. A total of 291 snakes have been released that has resulted in a total of 325 detections of 89 individuals. Of these, 55 were captured more than once, and the maximum number of detections of a single individual was 39. Natural recruitment (5 individuals) has also been detected. These results will be used inform the reintroductions at the current site, while also guiding monitoring of future reintroduced Louisiana Pinesnake populations.",oral,NA,2023,48
49,Modeling breeding pond habitat for amphibians of conservation concern,"The crawfish frog, Lithobates areolatus areolatus, and the Houston toad, Bufo houstonensis, are two native amphibian species of conservation concern in Texas. The crawfish frog is generally associated with prairies or grassland habitats which are one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America, and the federally endangered Houston toad requires a specific breeding habitat of pine and oak woodlands and savannas, specific soil geology, and shallow or ephemeral ponds. The Landscape Ecology Program at Texas Parks and Wildlife Department aims to support the conservation and restoration of these species’ breeding habitat through the development of a high-resolution map of ephemeral and permanent wetlands. To map potential breeding habitat, available LiDAR within both species’ geographic ranges were acquired and processed using Quick Terrain Modeler to produce a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The DEM was then standardized in ERDAS Imagine, and the landscape topographic sinks were identified using ArcGIS Hydrology Toolset. An object-based image analysis was performed in eCognition to extract bodies of water over 200 m2 from satellite imagery to determine which landscape sinks contained water during wet years. The LiDAR derived sink datasets were then modeled using randomForest in Rstudio using predictor variables to produce a final map of potential breeding habitat for each of these species.",oral,NA,2023,49
50,Survival of Repatriated Alligator Snapping Turtles in Native Texas Waters,"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is the largest freshwater turtle in North America. As such, M. temminckii are sought after for human consumption and are vulnerable to overharvest or bycatch. Despite having protection from harvest in Texas since the 1980s, M. temminckii are still harvested illegally for food and novelty products. Given their life history, such threats may exacerbate declines in local populations. Therefore, efforts that can bolster wild populations are of importance to M. temminckii conservation. In June 2021, 23 M. temminckii confiscated by federal agents were released at three predetermined sites in east Texas. To determine the feasibility of repatriation efforts, we attached VHF radios to these individuals and performed weekly telemetry checks until July 2022 to estimate survival. We estimated survival probabilities using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to account for inconsistencies in radiotelemetry data, and to assess mortality in the context of site and seasonal effects. Overall, we found that survival of repatriated M. temminckii was high. However, survival probabilities were greatly influenced due to differences in demographics across sites. We found the best-fit HMM with an interactive effect of site and season to be the strongest predictor of M. temminckii survival. Variation in resource availability (e.g., microhabitat availability) and site characteristics (i.e., hydrological regime) across seasons may influence repatriated M. temminckii survival. Long-term studies estimating survival are difficult but invaluable to conserve long-lived species. High survival of repatriated individuals highlights suitability of habitat and could be a tool to restore or bolster wild populations.",oral,NA,2023,50
51,Reestablishment and Increase of Spot-Tailed Earless Lizard Home Range Following,"Spot-tailed earless lizards (STEL) are rare species that were recently elevated from subspecies to full species status. Both populations have dramatically declined resulting in increases in conservation interests. Recent research found STEL home ranges to be 4X larger than similar species of the genus. In our observations of STEL, we noted that individuals fled from humans but did not return to their previous site of observation. Therefore, we outfitted 30 STEL with VHF transmitters to track their daily movements for 1 week, then in a cross-over design, we pursued half the STEL to locations approximately 100 m from their original observation site while maintaining a distance from the other half of STEL. We continued to monitor movements, and after another week, we pursued the second STEL group to a new location while maintaining a distance from the first STEL group. We found that non-harassed STEL maintain 0.09 ± 0.01 ha home ranges, but if harassed, they will escape to a new site and re-establish a previous-sized home range without returning to original home range sites. Only 1 STEL appeared to attempt to return to its original site, but was depredated as a result. Our results indicate that STEL home range size become 5.6X larger as a result of intensive tracking by researchers. Inflated or biased estimates of home range can result in misinterpretations that have potential to misguide conservation strategies and should be considered by future researchers when conducting home range studies of STEL.

52,Range expansion of Crested Caracaras over a 55-year period in three distinct,"Crested Caracaras (Caracara cheriway) are non-migratory raptors that exist as three populations in the United States (US) in Texas, Arizona, and Florida. Here, they inhabit open areas where their broad diet includes e.g., carrion, invertebrates, and small mammals. Occurrence records suggest that caracaras are expanding their distribution. Yet, the extent and rate of expansion is unknown. At the same time, caracaras appear to be increasing in urban areas suggesting they may be expanding into previously unoccupied habitat. We test these ideas by (1) assessing range expansion of caracaras separately for the three US populations over a 55-year period, and (2) evaluating changes in habitat occupancy over the same timeframe. We used point occurrence data collected between 1967 and 2021 from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Data were separated into 5-year time periods and overlaid on a 2x2km grid. For each 5-year period, the mean easting and northing of occupied cells was calculated separately for each population to estimate range centroids. The distance between each centroid and the outermost occupied cells was also calculated. We compared estimates to assess range shifts and expansion across time. While range expansion occurred in all populations, the greatest occurred for the Texas population. Using the National Land Cover Dataset, we also demonstrated that observations of caracaras in urban areas have increased. Our results have important implications for the management of caracaras, especially where they contribute to human-wildlife conflict, or where they are considered imperiled (Florida).",oral,NA,2023,52
53,The Impact of Microclimate on Nest Site Selection and Reproductive Success in the,"For cavity nesting birds, nest quality may depend on: 1) nest-hole orientation 2) solar radiation 3) amount of surrounding vegetation. We examined the impact of these factors on nest site occupancy and reproductive success in the Black-Crested Titmouse (Baeolophus atricristatus). Nest occupancy and measures of reproductive success (number of eggs laid, hatched, and fledged) were recorded among 99 nest boxes in central Texas in 2021. Orientation was measured with a compass. Solar radiation was estimated using semi-hemispherical photos taken via Google Street View. Vegetation was quantified with NDVI, and by the distance from each nest box to the nearest vegetation under 2 meters and over 2 meters. Occupied nests (n= 46) were significantly more likely to be oriented to the southwest; however, orientation of occupied nests varied widely. Occupancy was not related to vegetative measures. Clutch size and lay date (but not hatching success or fledging success) were significantly related to orientation: nests holding larger clutches were oriented north to northwest, and nests with earlier lay dates were oriented northeast. Lay date (but not clutch size or fledging success) was negatively correlated with distance to vegetation (over 2m), but not to other vegetation measures. Analyses of solar radiation are ongoing. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that nest site selection and reproductive success are influenced by microclimate. Our work will illuminate the factors that impact reproductive success in the Black-Crested Titmouse and has implications for artificial nest placement.",oral,NA,2023,53
54,Vocal behavior and urban avoidance in golden-cheeked warblers inhabiting exurban,"The golden-cheeked warbler is a state and federally listed species that breeds exclusively in Central Texas. Its breeding range can be characterized by regions of high- and low-density human development. The 35,000-acre Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (BCP) was set aside as mitigation land for the golden-cheeked warbler in Travis County, a region which is experiencing unprecedented human growth. The BCP is comprised of multiple land tracts, which range greatly in size and configuration. The City of Austin and Travis County, who serve as the primary owners and land managers, have been conducting intensive surveys of warbler use on 100-acre plots since 2009. They have also conducted several collaborative studies, such as an intensive song recording effort led by Chris Warren in 2008-10. We integrated new and previously collected data to assess vocal behavior and urban avoidance in golden-cheeked warblers found on BCP plots. Specifically, we compared B song composition between 2008-10 and 2021-22. Further, we assessed the impact of increasing percentages of impervious surfaces on the likelihood of detecting a golden-cheeked warbler within any particular 100-meter cell within 100-acre survey plots. Our results indicate that golden-cheeked warbler B song composition has changed significantly over time and that the species is strongly averse to impervious surfaces. While the reasons and implications of changing songs require additional exploration, the impact of impervious surfaces clearly supports the continued need for the preservation of large tracts of wildlands to maintain golden-cheeked warbler populations in exurban landscapes.",oral,NA,2023,54
55,Pugilistic Doves: Is Wing Morphology Associated with an Odd Form of Aggression,"Aggressive wing-slapping behavior is commonly observed in both White-winged Doves (Zenaida asiatica; WWDO) and Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura; MODO). Many species with similar behaviors, including other Columbidae species, exhibit morphological weaponization of wings. These adaptations take the form of skeletal projections such as spurs or bony knobs and may also include increased bone thickness or density. Such weapons are typically found on the extensor process of the carpometacarpus. Bone modification is more pronounced in groups that participate more in competition and defense, and sexual dimorphism in these features is common. We have collected data on the size and shape of wing bones in adult WWDO and MODO to explore the hypothesis of bone weaponization in these birds. We predict that if weaponization does exist, we would observe sexual dimorphism in wing bones, particularly the carpometacarpus. We also predict skeletal differences between the colonially nesting WWDO and the less social MODO. After controlling for body size differences, we analyzed the linear measurements and shape of the carpometacarpus bone, as well as of the extensor process on this bone. There is a significant difference in the dorso-ventral thickness of the minor carpometacarpal digit between males of the two species, with thickness in MODO being approximately 10% greater, but no other significant differences have been identified. Although one of twelve measurements is consistent with one of our predictions, we do not consider this overwhelming support of our hypothesis. WWDO and MODO appear to possess no identifiable osteological weaponization, despite their wing-slapping behavior.",oral,NA,2023,55
56,Parental Attentiveness of a Songbird across Varying Temperature Gradients,"Bergmann’s rule predicts body size differences across latitudes associated with temperatures. One possible mechanism is parental behavioral differences, such as time on or off a nest or food delivery rates, that could influence growth rates resulting in body mass differences. Our study compares behavioral measurements at house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nests in Texas, Kentucky, and North Dakota associated with location, temperature, and nestling body size. We monitored house sparrows in nest boxes at our study locations during the spring and summer of 2022. We video recorded parental behaviors on incubation day 5, 6 or 7 and posthatching on day 5, 6 or 7 from approximately 0630-1130 hrs. We collected morphological measurements of nestlings every two days post-hatch (day 2–10). Preliminary results show that female on-bouts were longer in North Dakota (n = 26, mean = 34.6 min/hr, 95% CI = 31.6–37.7) than in Texas (n = 27, mean = 26.2 min/hr, 95% CI = 20.2–32.3), and feeding rates are higher in North Dakota (n = 18, mean = 17.4/hr, 95% CI = 13.9-21.1/hr) than in Texas (n = 29, mean = 10.1, 95% CI = 8.2-11.9/hr). We are finalizing our remaining analyses on behavior, body size, and temperature. Using house sparrows as a model for songbirds, this study will increase our understanding of how parental feeding rates are associated with differences in nestling body size and temperature, with implications for how birds might respond to climate change.

57,Implementing novel trail camera-based techniques for estimating demographic,"Density and recruitment are hard to estimate, and quantifying them through physical capture can be invasive, expensive, and impractical. The use of camera traps as a tool for collecting demographic data has grown exponentially in recent years due to ease of use and benefits associated with collecting data noninvasively. Further, recent advances in unmarked abundance models and camera trap technology facilitate better estimates of demographic parameters of unmarked species. Our objective was to use the space-to-event unmarked abundance model (STE) to estimate density and recruitment of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a densely forested area. Previous work with STE did not account for camera viewable area (viewshed), potentially leading to biased estimates associated with viewshed assumptions. Further, STE has not been used to quantify recruitment, so we will extend the usefulness of this unmarked model. In 2021 we randomly deployed 100 cameras across two wildlife management areas in southeast Oklahoma. At deployment, we measured the viewshed at each camera by taking six maximum distance measurements to account for variation in forest structure across the viewshed. We set camera traps to synchronously take time-lapse photographs every 10 minutes until they were retrieved, resulting in a sample of 3 million photos. Using STE, we successfully estimated late-summer white-tailed deer density at both sites which allowed us to derive fawn recruitment rates. When compared to estimates derived from an assumed viewshed, our results reported higher densities when viewshed is uniquely measured per camera, indicating that viewshed can have profound impacts on estimating density.",oral,NA,2023,57
58,Temperature drives habitat selection and tolerance of predation risk in a climate,"Spatiotemporal partitioning of habitat use is a common behavior that species employ to avoid predation. Balancing demands of foraging and thermoregulation under predation risk introduces competing drivers of selection often underappreciated in studies of predator-prey dynamics. As temperatures rise due to climate change, thermoregulatory pressures will increasingly impact movement patterns by forcing prey to accept higher predation risk in exchange for thermal refuge. For instance, as Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) utilize vegetation to ambush prey, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter: “deer”) may select safer areas at the cost of increased solar radiation exposure. We tested the hypothesis that thermoregulatory demands influence predation risk tolerance in prey and that the strength of the effect will vary between nocturnal and dial periods. We assessed step selection of 224 deer from June through September 2015 to 2018 in the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge and Big Cypress National Preserve in southern Florida, USA. Resource selection varied with temperature, suggesting the thermal landscape is an important factor of selection. As temperature increased, deer increased their use of high-risk areas, indicating deer were less predation risk averse when confronted with high thermoregulatory costs. However, this pattern was temporally dynamic. Temperature influenced predation risk tolerance during both nocturnal and dial periods but was strongest during nocturnal hours, when panthers are most active. These movements indicate that the need for thermal refugia influences predator avoidance and highlights the critical importance of landscape features which offer thermal shelter.",oral,NA,2023,58
59,Early-life conditions: a roadmap to larger antlered white-tailed deer,"Early-life programming prepares an individual for the environment they are expected to exist in through life. This programming can be adaptive or mal-adaptive depending on the match or mismatch between the expected and the actual environment. In the event of an environmental mismatch, life history traits can be negatively influenced. We evaluated the effects of early-life conditions of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on the relationship between antler and body mass utilizing a 15-year dataset containing annual antler and body weight measurements for 471 known-age white-tailed deer. These individuals were born in one of two 445-hectare, high-fenced pastures or a 2.5-hectare pen. Within the pen, movement was limited, predators did not occur, and sires were selected for large antler sizes. All deer had access to ad libitum food and water. Deer born in pens were released to the larger pasture at ~4-months of age. The analysis utilized a linear mixed effects model with antler score and body weight as dependent variables. Independent variables were age and birth site. Capture year and animal ID were treated as random variables. Offspring born in pens were smaller bodied with larger antlers when compared to pasture-born deer. Our results suggest early-life conditions permanently influence the allocation of energetic resources towards either antlers or body mass in white-tailed deer. Whether these findings are adaptive or maladaptive depends on the expected environment these individuals will exist, as well as management goals and practices.",oral,NA,2023,59
60,Temporal variation in resources influences offspring quality of white-tailed deer in a,"Timing of resource availability has important implications for population performance. Resource availability relative to consumer requirement influences the consumer’s ability to acquire nutrients as energetic demands fluctuate. Temporal variation matters for wildlife; however, the period when it matters most remains unknown. Therefore, we determined the biological period at which rainfall was most predictive of offspring quality. We used rainfall as our environmental variable because it varies greatly and directly affects plant growth. We used white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as a model species and offspring body mass as a proxy for quality, as mass is correlated with survival and time to primiparity. We captured 480 fawns and 571 1.5-year-olds in the fall at four sites in South Texas from 2011 to 2021. We assigned precipitation data from seven biological seasons we hypothesized would affect mass to each deer record. We used linear mixed-effects models to identify the period when rainfall was most predictive of mass. Rainfall in the early growing season (April), approximately three months prior to birth of fawns, had the greatest effect on deer mass. For every ten cm increase in rainfall, fawn body mass increased by 2.17 kg (P=0.01) and yearling body mass increased by 2.88 kg (P = 0.04). Our results demonstrate that offspring quality is most affected by rainfall in seasons relevant to plant phenology rather than rainfall in seasons relevant to reproductive chronology. Therefore, when assessing how temporal variation in resources influences population performance, managers should consider multiple trophic levels to fully capture this process.",oral,NA,2023,60
61,Estimating Breeding Values and the Heritability of Antler Traits in White-tailed,"Luxury phenotypic traits (horns and antlers) are both tools and targets for the management of ungulate populations. For instance, antler restrictions regulate males eligible for harvest by protecting younger age classes. Culling or selective harvest attempts to improve the horn or antler size of future generations by removing undesirable phenotypes from the breeding pool. However, the effects of these management strategies–intentional or unintentional–strongly depend on the heritability of the traits and the ability of offspring to develop and display them. Mature animals with access to high-quality nutrition typically develop larger antlers, but the genetic influence on antler development in wild populations of cervids is poorly understood. We analyzed an ongoing, long-term research project that has followed multiple half-sibling cohorts of wild white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to maturity. We recorded 2,167 antler measurements from 505 unique individuals. We estimated the narrow-sense heritability(h2) for 5 common antler characteristics: gross Boone & Crockett score (0.35), inside spread (0.00), main beam length (0.17), antler mass (0.27), and tine length (0.59) by regressing the mean offspring antler measurements of each antler trait on their sire's maximum antler measurement for each trait. Antler restrictions implemented on traits with low heritability will have the least chance of unintentional effects of harvest, such as high-grading. Conversely, selecting for traits with higher heritabilities will produce the largest gains per generation. Our results can help wildlife managers and legislators make better-informed decisions and regulations when managing cervid populations to produce the highest quality luxury phenotypic traits.

62,The Thermal Ecology of Reintroduced and Native Texas Horned Lizards,"Due to habitat loss, the Texas horned lizard (THL) (Phrynosoma cornutum) has declined across its historic range. To date, reintroduction attempts for the species have been unsuccessful, calling into question the suitability of the habitat. THLs require suitable thermal habitat to meet their thermoregulatory needs, because of this, understanding the thermal habitat requirements of THLs is important. The objective of this study was to determine thermal habitat preferences of reintroduced THLs at Mason Mountain WMA (n=4 lizards) compared to a nearby natural population of THLs on the White Ranch (n=12 lizards). We also compared the thermal conditions of different microhabitats between the two sites. We used thermal dataloggers (n=24) to record the temperatures in different microhabitats throughout the day at each site, then compared how much time these data loggers were within the lizard’s optimal and critical temperature range. The ground temperature selection by the lizards versus random points on the ground were assessed to see what factors affected selection including, study site, time of day, and microhabitat. It was found that the two sites didn’t differ from each other in terms of microhabitat thermal quality (p=0.51) but covered microhabitats provided significantly better thermal habitat quality than the other microhabitats (p<0.01). Like other studies, vegetative cover seems to play an important role in thermal habitat quality. These findings suggest that habitat management should maintain vegetative cover for THLs, and more work should be done to look at what specifics types of vegetative cover provide the best thermal habitat.",oral,NA,2023,62
63,Use of Environmental DNA in Wetland Habitats for Detecting Cryptic Species: A,"The southeastern United States represents one of the most ecologically diverse regions in the world, though this area has experienced declines in surface area of wetland habitats. This may be particularly detrimental to wildlife, such as the cryptic Western Chicken Turtle (WCT, Deirochelys reticularia miaria), due to their dependency on and movement between intermittent wetlands. The WCT is a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Texas and is currently under review for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has previously been used to document cryptic species, though application within intermittent wetlands is limited. To inform the Species Status Assessment process for the WCT and to evaluate applicability of eDNA within intermittent wetlands, we collected samples from three matrix types: ambient surface water (MA), resuspended sediment (MR), and soil (MS). Water samples were filtered through 3 µm cellulose nitrate (CN) filters prior to qPCR analyses. In total, 66 sites were sampled monthly from March-August over three years (2020-2022). Overall, 745 samples (MA = 337; MR = 338; MS = 70) were analyzed via qPCR. Of the 66 sites, 16 (24.2%) yielded positive (two or more qPCR replicates) or potential (one qPCR replicate) detections for WCT. Across events with detections, three (4.7%) resulted in detections for all matrix types. For all matrices, MA returned the highest proportion of detections (70.3%). While we have demonstrated that eDNA can be used to confirm presence of WCT in intermittent wetlands, future studies should consider matrix type and site conditions.",oral,NA,2023,63
64,Three-toed Box Turtle (Terrapene carolina) Spatial Ecology at Multiple Scales in,"Box turtle (Terrapene carolina) populations are steadily declining due their unique natural history, effects of climate change, and anthropogenic land use change. There is a need for updated information on box turtle space use to inform conservation efforts. This study used VHF radiotelemetry and GPS data loggers to examine box turtle macro- and microhabitat use in North Texas. Box turtle home range sizes averaged 6.6ha (range=0.79-18.08, n=23), with males (n=9) having larger home ranges than females (n=14; W=31.5, P=0.05). Home range size was best explained by sex and body size. Overall, the percentage of the home range that was categorized as high-quality box turtle habitat was negatively correlated with home range size. At the macrohabitat scale, the most informative variable for box turtle habitat selection was NDVI. Also at the macro-habitat scale, box turtles further selected for deciduous forest more than expected and wetlands less than expected by chance (Fisher’s exact test, P<0.0001). At the microhabitat scales, box turtles selected for sites with higher percent litter (t=-2.16, P<0.05) and understory cover (t=-5.03, P<0.05). Using CART analysis, we partitioned the nested importance of macro- and microhabitat and identified NDVI as the single most important variable for predicting suitable box turtle habitat. Box turtles were associated with an NDVI >0.38, areas with this NDVI have a 65% probability of use. We postulate that NDVI would be useful model the availability of high-quality box turtle habitat at landscape scales to aid in management and conservation efforts.",oral,NA,2023,64
65,Validation of an Environmental DNA Protocol to Detect Red-eared Slider Turtles,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is genomic DNA shed from an organism found in environmental samples such as soil and water. Analysis of eDNA extracted from water sources may provide a relatively quick method to investigate semi-aquatic turtle community and is also extendable to other aquatic vertebrate communities. eDNA methodology requires validation of both field techniques and of an assay in the laboratory. Our objectives were to determine a protocol to evaluate the use of eDNA for red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) with a known presence through trapping at the McGillivary and Leona McKie Muse Wildlife Management area (798 ha) in Brown County, Texas and to evaluate the decay rate of turtle feces to determine the probability of detection over time using eDNA. We conducted our eDNA study April–September of 2021, and we detected red-eared sliders in 11 of our 70 water samples. We sent 42 of our samples to College Station, Texas for next generation sequencing. This will be able to confirm our positive results and identify positives we missed. Our decay rate study currently suggests that turtle DNA for fecal samples can persist for 2 weeks at 10, 20, and 30 degrees Celsius. We will complete results for the decay rate study by December 2022. Our study will contribute to our understanding of using eDNA of turtles for conservation and management.",oral,NA,2023,65
66,Comparative Calling Phenology of Anurans Across Geographic Gradients,"Anurans (frogs and toads) in North America with wide geographic ranges can exhibit latitudinal and geographic variation in their reproductive ecology. To explore patterns in geographic variation of their timing, intensity, and abiotic correlates of their reproduction, we quantified the calling phenology of four widespread species of anurans across three sites. Automated recording units were deployed in 2015 at Attwater Prairie Chicken NWR (ANWR; n = 5 ponds), Powderhorn Ranch (PHR; n = 3 ponds), and Davy Crockett National Forest, DCNF, and SFA Experimental Forest, SFAEF (ETX; n = 6 ponds) to passively record for 6 minutes each night (1min/hr; 2100 h–0200 h). The number of males calling per species were counted (range: 0-5) to calculate the average number of males calling per pond per night. Calling index graphs were made to display mean number of males calling. Logistic regression was used to determine correlations between abiotic factors and the probability of males calling. All species in ANWR and PHR had significantly longer calling windows and intensities compared to ETX. Onset of males calling for these species is triggered by temperature and rainfall, but responses to these correlates vary between sites. Variations in probabilities of males calling may be attributed to habitat and climatic differences present at each site. Overall, anurans with wide ranges exhibit slight differences in their reproductive phenologies. Tools & Technology",oral,NA,2023,66
67,Seed-Spec: A Native Seed Blend Development Tool,"Abstract: Establishing native vegetation in any restoration project can be a challenging task. The species and varieties that match the site must be identified and used to help ensure adequate establishment and persistence. Data exists to help project managers identify what species are native to a given area and commercially available, but can be cumbersome, not user friendly, and time consuming. Bamert Seed Company has worked with Colorado State University to develop a web application to easily identify a project area of interest (AOI) and provide information on native species composition for the AOI. The tool will provide a list of commercially available species that correspond to the plants that grow natively in the AOI and intuitively walk the user through developing a site-specific native seed blend. The recommended seeding rate from NRCS will be used to calculate the pounds of pure live seed (PLS) that will be needed for the project. Users will have the ability to adjust the seeding rate based on their establishment objectives and seeding method they will be using. Having this tool will allow the land manager a timely way to determine the best blend for their AOI and get the seed blend to a vendor/seed dealer with knowledge that the species selected will work for their specific site. We will discuss the importance of native plants and the benefits they bring to restoration projects such as adding biodiversity and improving soil health.",oral,NA,2023,67
68,White-tailed Deer Surveys with Thermal Drones and Distance Sampling,"Improvements in thermal imaging and changes in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations provide new opportunities for drone-based night wildlife surveys. Advances in thermal technology include isotherm capabilities, which highlights a range of temperatures producing higher-contrast imagery. Our goal was to evaluate nighttime surveys of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in South Texas using a drone and a thermal camera programmed to search for specific temperature ranges. Our objectives were 1) determine if nighttime surveys increased detection probabilities relative to daytime surveys, 2) whether isotherm technology improved number of detections relative to traditional technology and 3) determine the effect of season on detection rates. We surveyed a 102-ha game-fenced property during February, April, and July 2022. Distance sampling analyses indicated that detection probability was .63-1.00, slightly higher than the daytime surveys. The isotherm setting did not significantly increase number of detections relative to traditional thermal technology. However, the isotherm allowed us to identify deer in warmer ambient temperatures (24°C) than traditional thermal technology (~20°C). Further, contrast between the deer and the background was noticeably better with isotherm vs traditional thermal. In terms of seasonality, detection rates vary due to changes in swath width most likely from fluctuations in canopy cover. Overall, our results indicate that deer are missed during both daytime and nighttime surveys; incorporating distance sampling methods can improve accuracy of estimated population sizes by correcting for visibility bias. Additionally, matching isotherm settings to ambient temperatures allowed us to survey during temperatures previously thought to be too warm for ideal contrast.",oral,NA,2023,68
69,Molecular evolution of the prion protein gene (PRNP) in pronghorn (Antilocapra,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) affects both native and non-native North American cervids and has become a major conservation issue for wildlife managers worldwide. As CWD expands geographically, concerns about management and species susceptibility continue to be part of a larger narrative of wildlife management, conservation, and human health. Given how CWD is transmitted, and the history of spontaneous generation of novel prion diseases, the possibility of interfamilial transmission has become a concern. Historically, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) have been sympatric with multiple susceptible Cervids and occur within the CWD core endemic area of Colorado and Wyoming. Our previous research identified that pronghorn have one additional octapeptide repeat, for a total of 6 repeats, rather than the 5 peptide repeats present in Cervids. Additionally, pronghorn share similarities to Cervid genotypes characterized by codons 95, 96, 116, 132, and 225, which might confer greater susceptibility to CWD in specific Cervid species. Given pronghorn have this additional octapeptide repeat, possess the genotype PrPARQ that affects relative scrapie susceptibility, and are aligned with Cervids for the five key codons for CWD susceptibility, more research into the evolution of PRNP in pronghorn is needed to gain a better understanding of susceptibility of pronghorn to CWD and other prion diseases. We are using phylogenetic analyses, including dated trees, to better understand the evolution of PRNP in pronghorn.",oral,NA,2023,69
70,Using 3D models of forage cover structure to monitor cattle grazed upland gamebird,"Upland gamebirds require a diverse plant composition and arrangement of woody, herbaceous, and bare ground cover to complete each of their life stages. Monitoring rangelands for these species can often be time-consuming, and sampling becomes subjective due to the heterogeneity of the composition and structure of vegetation. Drone imagery and remote sensing have been used to perform research in rangelands with the purpose to quantify and measure landscape features and estimate forage mass. In this study, we used drones to evaluate forage utilization in a grazing system that is designed to improve Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) habitat. We collected imagery on two dates from eight 10 ha plots at an altitude of 50 m in a grazed pasture (4 plots) and a non-grazed pasture (4 plots). We created an orthomosaic, Digital Surface, and Terrain Models (DSM and DTM respectively) using structure-from-motion. We generated a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) to obtain vegetation height. we classified the nDSM vegetation into bare ground (0-5 cm), medium (5-38 cm), and tall (>38 cm). We calculated percent land cover (PLAND), mean patch area (MPA), and patch density (PD). Preliminary results show the spatial configuration of classes is different, grazed pasture has larger amounts of areas < 5 cm, and higher PD and lower MPA of medium-height vegetation. The amount and distribution of vegetation height for bobwhites was improved following grazing. The use of drones has the potential to look at the interspersion of landscape features and vegetation structure to evaluate upland gamebird habitat. Student Poster Abstracts",oral,NA,2023,70
71,Using Accelerometer Data to Remotely Categorize Wild Animal Behavior,"Accelerometers (ACC) in tracking devices are a powerful tool in studying movementbased behavior of wild animals. Quantifying fine-scale movements of body orientation in animals fitted with tracking devices allows researchers to investigate important biological and ecological questions without directly observing the animals’ behavior. Here, we show the application of ACC and how we will analytically categorize different behavioral states of tracked northern pintails (Anas acuta; hereafter pintails). In an ongoing, continental-scale tracking study, we fitted female pintails with 15g GPS/GSM/ACC tracking devices. To quantify behavioral states in these tracked birds, we fitted these same tracking devices to captive pintails and filmed them under controlled settings. We collected 127 hours of video footage of birds exhibiting an array of behaviors. Our behaviors of interest are walking, swimming, stationary, flight, and three types of foraging behavior, tipping, surface dabbling, and land feeding. These 127 hours of video footage will be used to classify ACC bursts into known behaviors. We will test different machine learning algorithms for behavior classification using training and test data and we will select the algorithm that most successfully classifies behaviors. Classified behaviors using ACC signatures will assist in quantifying daily activity budgets of tracked pintails by matching ACC signatures. We expect these behavioral data to assist in addressing important questions in pintail winter ecology and spring migration ecology.",poster,NA,2023,71
72,Avian Community Responds Positively to Prairie and Emergent Wetland Restoration at,"Habitat loss and fragmentation due to agricultural development and urbanization are leading causes of biodiversity decline worldwide. Specifically, grassland and wetland bird species depending upon these habitats are seriously declining and are currently considered species of conservation concern. To meet ever-growing population demands, North Texas Municipal Water District has recently constructed the Bois d’Arc reservoir to provide freshwater to 1.7 million North Texans. This is the first major reservoir to be built in Texas in approximately 30 years. The environmental impacts of this reservoir are being mitigated by restoring ~ 6900 ha of degraded range land to native prairie and emergent wetland habitat at Riverby Ranch Mitigation site. The goal of our research was to use the avian community as bioindicators to assess the progress of this restoration. Post-restoration data were collected using point-count sampling locations in restored wetlands and grassland habitats. Similar surveys were conducted on a working ranch and natural prairie as reference sites. Grassland bird density was greater at Riverby Ranch (4.65 birds/ha) compared to either the working ranch (3.11 birds/ha) or natural prairie (1.63 birds/ha). Species Richness was also higher on Riverby Ranch (n = 67.5, SE +/- 3.80) compared the working ranch (n = 26.2, SE +/- 2.79) or the natural prairie (n = 14.6, SE +/- 1.06). Overall, soil enhancements, topographical restoration techniques, and the planting of diverse vegetation at the restoration areas were effective in attracting and supporting a diverse avian community of grassland and wetland specialists.",poster,NA,2023,72
73,Foraging Behavior of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) is Influenced by the Time of,"Recent monitoring has shown that American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) populations are declining across North America. Several researchers have suggested these declines are most likely attributed to unfavorable conditions encountered during migration or on kestrel wintering grounds. To understand factors that may influence winter ecology and survival of American Kestrels, we quantified the foraging success of falcons during the daylight hours in Denton County, North Texas. We did intensive observations on focal kestrels for 30-min time intervals throughout the day and recorded the number of foraging attempts and successful prey captures. Behavioral data were then analyzed using regression analysis. We collected foraging data during 324 observation sessions over three field seasons. Both foraging attempts and successful foraging attempts were significantly positively related to the time of day (ℝ2 =0.626 and 0.684, respectively, and p<.01). Peak foraging activity occurred at temperatures above 25°C when kestrels made an average of 4.8 attempts/hr and success peaked at 79% likelihood of capture per foraging attempt. There was a positive linear relationship of foraging attempts and success with temperature (ℝ2 =0.821 and 0.905, respectively and p values of <.01). Additionally, kestrels exhibited a peak in foraging activity and success in the month of February, before migration, probably in response to the need to sequester fat in preparation for spring migration. We suggest these positive linear relationships can most likely be attributed to the increasing activity in arthropods as the temperature gets warmer.",poster,NA,2023,73
74,Connecting the Dots: Documenting the Full Annual Period Movement Patterns of,"The American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) is a widely distributed raptor across North America. Despite their abundance, populations have declined by over 50% since the 1960s. Reasons for the decline are mostly unknown, but data from nest box studies indicate relatively high reproductive success, suggesting that the cause of the decline may be related to survival overwinter and during migration. To understand the full annual cycle of American Kestrels and identify potential areas of risk or mortality, we deployed Lotek PinPoint 40 GPS loggers (trackers) on 20 kestrels wintering throughout north Texas in 2020-21. GPS fixes were recorded every 5 days during expected stationary periods, and every 3 days during migratory periods. Seven individuals (35%) returned the following season (2021-22) with trackers intact, of which, data were remotely downloaded from two individuals. One adult male migrated 1,083 km to northern Nebraska and one juvenile female migrated 878 km to northern Kansas. Utilizing a 95% minimum convex polygon method, the male had a winter home range of 60.8 ha and a summer home range of 92.2 ha. The female had a smaller home range of 34.3 ha for the winter and 37.8 ha in the summer. This is one of the first documented full-annual-cycle migration routes and nesting locations of wintering migratory American Kestrels. By examining kestrel movement ecology and annual survivorship, we will begin to understand factors influencing risk and to identify habitats and locations requiring conservation protection to stabilize the population trajectory of the American Kestrel.",poster,NA,2023,74
75,Anuran Communities and their Calling Phenologies: Using Acoustic Data to Establish,"Frogs are cryptic animals that are sensitive to abiotic changes in their environment. The calling phenologies of frogs can be useful tools to determine the species’ detection probability, based on characteristic features of their vocalizations. I monitored ten species of anurans for one year in Colorado County, Texas with automatic recording devices. My project focuses on the environmental factors that influence the calling phenology of the Cricket frog (Acris blanchardi), Green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), Striped chorus frog (Pseudacris fouquettei), Eastern narrowmouth toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis), Southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus), Crawfish frog (Lithobates areolatus), Gulf coast toad (Incilius nebulifer), American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), Green frog (Lithobates clamitans), and Squirrel treefrog (Hyla squirella) in 2015. I modeled the calling behavior of each frog individually. My models show that air temperature and rain accumulated after five or ten days are significant factors that influence frog calling behavior. Most frogs in my study called from the months of March to July, when the temperature was between 24 ºC and 30 ºC. Additionally, rain accumulation above ten millimeters over ten days generally predicted a higher probability of calling behavior. Understanding the phenology of amphibians is vital for identifying and supporting their populations.",poster,NA,2023,75
76,Influence of traffic volume on the variation in the mammal community composition,"Disturbance from vehicle noise and human activity extends into the nearby habitat, creating a road effect zone characterized by changes in the wildlife community structure and species’ behavior. This can impact conservation efforts along roads, such as wildlife crossing construction. To ensure that conservation efforts are effective, we must understand how vehicle traffic impacts mammals living around roads. We set up camera traps along a low-traffic highway on the East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch in Willacy County and along a high-traffic highway on a private ranch located in Kenedy County in March 2022. We set up cameras using a randomized block design along seven transects set perpendicular to the highway. Seven cameras were set up in each transect, at 200 m intervals, starting 50 m from the highway. We assessed how traffic volume and distance from highway affected mammal diversity, richness, and community composition. We have detected ocelot, bobcat, coyote, badger, raccoon, nilgai, white-tailed deer, Virginia opossum, eastern cottontail, javelina, and feral hog on camera traps. Species richness and diversity were greater further from roads, especially on the high-volume highway. Our study will provide information on how carnivores, ungulates, and other mammals use these road effect zones and how vehicle traffic impacts use. By comparing a low-traffic road to a high-traffic road, we will provide key information to landowners and the Texas Department of Transportation about how traffic volume could impact management practices of working lands around highways and future highway mitigation efforts for ocelots and other mammals.",poster,NA,2023,76
77,"An Evaluation Of Small Mammal Diversity, Population Demography, Occupancy, And","Over recent decades, row crop irrigation systems have become increasingly popular on the semi-arid Southern High Plains (SHP). However, no information exists pertaining to how these systems impact small mammal population demographics. Also, no data exists on frequency and intensity of small mammal damage to irrigation infrastructure. The goal of our study was to understand small mammal population demography and damage to three types of irrigation systems on the SHP. Our first objective was to assess small mammal population demographics among three types of irrigation: 1) dryland (control), 2) center pivot, and 3) subsurface drip. Our second objective was to assess if small mammals demonstrated any selection preference among different types of irrigation tubing. Both objectives were also conducted within three crop growth stages: 1) early, 2) vegetative, and 3) reproductive growth stages of corn and sorghum crops. We captured, marked, and released small mammals using H.B. Sherman traps on 36 study sites, May-August 2021 – 2022 for our first objective. We built exclosures that included different types of gnawing materials and used camera-traps to assess if small mammals selected or avoided materials for gnawing. Preliminary results indicate that small mammal abundance was significantly higher in both types of irrigated fields compared to the dryland control and gnawing materials were chosen at random.",poster,NA,2023,77
78,Fire and Mice: The Effects of Prescribed Fire on Rodent Communities,"Prescribed fire is a common method for managing rangelands for livestock and wildlife. In areas like the coastal sand plains ecoregion of Texas, prescribed fire is being used to remove mature gulf cordgrass (Spartina spartinae) and create early successional conditions that provide greater nutritional value for livestock. The long-term benefits of these fires for large herbivores have been shown, but the effects on small mammals that use this vegetation for food and shelter are largely understudied. Small mammal species (i.e., mouse and rat species) can be used as indicators for ecosystem health, functioning and overall biodiversity. To understand the response and recovery of these species to prescribed fire, a long-term monitoring study was conducted on the East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch. From 2019 to 2022, we monitored unburned control and treatment areas; treatment areas were burned at varying intervals during winter (dormant season). We used Sherman live traps in 200 × 200 m trapping grids to assess changes in abundance and species richness. We will use capture-mark-recapture methods to estimate abundance where all individuals are uniquely marked with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Over 4 years, 8,050 unique individuals were caught, with 10 different species identified. Preliminary results show that species richness ranged from 4 to 8 across trapping grids, and that small mammal communities recover from prescribed fire within 2–3 years. These data will help managers assess the health of rangeland ecosystems and determine a prescribed fire schedule that can benefit livestock and wildlife.",poster,NA,2023,78
79,Potential Effects of Coprophagous Behavior in Texas Tortoises,"Coprophagy is a known behavior of Texas tortoises (Gopherus berlandieri); however, the extent of this behavior has not been documented. It is largely unknown whether Texas tortoises display preferences for their own scat, other tortoises’ scat, or even the scat of other species. Therefore, we studied this behavior by placing 10 Texas tortoises individually in a 10 m2 pen, and providing 20-g of various randomized scat types in a cafeteria-style experiment. Scat choice included the tortoises’ own scat, which was collected during the days prior to the experiment, scat from other Texas tortoises, and scat from raccoons (Procyon lotor), coyotes (Canis latrans), and nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus). These species were selected because they were the most prevalent scat on the landscape associated with Texas tortoises. Quantity of scat consumed was measured every 12-hours during a 48-hr period. Similar quantity of each scat was placed in containers that were exposed to the environment and used as controls for potential shrink:swell due to desiccation from heat or swelling from humidity. Seven of the 10 tortoises ate at least one scat type and one tortoise consumed some of each scat type. Texas tortoises displayed individual preference for scat type but did not display a generalized preference for scat type. Five tortoises consumed raccoon scat, which creates a potential mortality and risk factors associated with Baylisascariasis procyonis parasitic infection.",poster,NA,2023,79
80,Habitat Preferences of Texas Tortoises in Southern Texas,"Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) populations were once distributed throughout southern Texas with densities as high as 16 tortoises/ha. More recent studies have estimated densities at 0.26 tortoise/ha, and their distribution has become sporadic throughout their historic range. Populations of Texas tortoises are thought to be restricted to thorn scrub and coastal prairie habitats. Older studies (~50 years) found Texas tortoises in loma habitat; however, the importance of such habitat to tortoises remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a habitat availability and use analysis for Texas tortoises in southern Texas. We collected 149 tortoises within a 270-ha area. Of the 8 habitats identified within our study area, Texas tortoises only used the grassland loma in greater proportion than available, with 120 tortoises (80.5%) located within that habitat. Tortoises used evergreen loma and salt prairie habitats in proportion to their availability, and wetlands, open water, coastal flats, dredge spoils, and thorn scrub habitats much less than those habitats’ availability. Density of Texas tortoises within the grassland loma was 3.9 tortoises/ha, which is a 15-fold increase from the 0.26 tortoise/ha estimate. Our results suggest that thorn scrub is not a preferred habitat by Texas tortoises and loma habitats should be protected as critical habitat for this state-threatened reptile.",poster,NA,2023,80
81,Is Agriculture Harmful to Spot-Tailed Earless Lizards?,"Spot-tailed earless lizards (STEL) are rare species whose population numbers and distribution have drastically declined. One hypothesis for their decline includes agricultural practices. Our objectives were to determine if agriculture practices resulted in direct or indirect negative impacts. We built a 1-ha enclosure to simulate a crop field. We placed 20 STEL outfitted with VHF transmitters to monitor their movements. We disked and mowed the enclosure. In both cases STEL that were above ground fled the approaching agricultural equipment, while underground STEL remained underground and the equipment would pass over them. Mortality or injury to STEL did not occur. We then placed 4 groups of 16 STEL, of which half served in the treatment and control groups, respectively, into separate 38-L aquaria. Roundup® (herbicide) and Besiege® (pesticide) were either sprayed directly on STEL within aquaria or STEL removed, applied to substrate, and STEL returned after the spray dried. STEL snout-vent length and weight were measured at day 0 and 14. Mortality did not differ between treatment and control STEL. Growth was unaffected by Round-up®; however, weight gain was less for both juvenile and adult STEL by direct and indirect spray methods. Besiege® affected juvenile and adult STEL growth and weight gain by both spray methods. Lizards were monitored an additional 30 days where growth and weight gain between the treatment and control STEL were similar again. Therefore, it appears that agriculture practices have a mild, indirect negative impact on STEL.",poster,NA,2023,81
82,Loggerhead Shrike Predation of Spot-Tailed Earless Lizards,"Spot-tailed earless lizards (STEL; Holbrookia lacerata (Plateau STEL), and H. subcaudalis (Tamaulipan STEL)) were once distributed throughout central and southern Texas; however, today, their distribution is patchy across only portions of their previous range. Theories as to why their distributions has shrunk include brush and invasive grass encroachment, agricultural practices, and predation; however, few publications document predation of STEL. We built a 1-ha enclosure in southern Texas and outfitted 30 STEL with VHF transmitters and followed their movements and mortalities from August – October 2022. During this time, 25 of 30 STEL (83%) were depredated by loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus). We observed shrikes in the area and all 25 STEL were found impaled on mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) thorns, a known behavior of shrikes. Remaining populations of STEL are found primarily in agricultural fields that lack thorn trees and barbed-wire fences by which shrikes could utilize for their unique predation tactic. More research is needed to determine the extent to which shrikes could be significant factors in the distributional decline of STEL.",poster,NA,2023,82
83,Noisescape along Wildlife Road Mortality Mitigation Areas in Southern Texas,"Continuing urban and human expansion contributes to destruction, fragmentation, and degradation of wildlife habitat. Increased noise from this expansion can have negative influences on wildlife, including increased fitness costs, decreased health, and population fragmentation. Decibels can be weighted for different frequency responses, A-weighting (dBA) or C-weighting (dBC), or as Z-weighting (dBZ), which is linear or unweighted. In Cameron County, the Texas Department of Transportation constructed nine wildlife crossing structures (WCS) with noncontinuous exclusion fencing on Farm-to-Market (FM) 106 and five WCS and 18 wildlife guards with continuous exclusion fencing on State Highway (SH) 100, to mitigate endangered ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) road mortalities. Our objectives were to: 1) describe the noise levels along each road and at each WCS; 2) describe the noise levels in the habitat 1 km out from each road; and 3) understand if wildlife use of WCS would be best predicted by noise measurements in dBZ, dBA, and/or dBC. WCS were monitored with camera trap arrays that consisted of four cameras on each side. Noise levels were monitored with NSRT_mk3 sound level meters. A twofactor analysis of variance was used to compare average noise levels between WCS. Logistic regressions were used to compare noise levels at each decibel weighting in relation to complete crossings through the WCS of target species. This study will help establish a baseline noisescape for each highway and contribute to the understanding of how noise propagates from each road in different vegetation types.",poster,NA,2023,83
84,Stopover Habitat Associations of an Imperiled Migratory Bird in The Central Flyway,"Migratory shorebirds in North America have experienced significant declines in the past 50 years. One-third of shorebird species are considered “tipping point” species that show continuous accelerated declines, which could lead to a 50% loss in the next 50 years. As a longdistance migrant who depend on grasslands throughout most of its lifecycle, the Buff-breasted Sandpiper is a species of global conservation concern and has been identified as a flagship species by the Arctic Migratory Bird Initiative and the Midcontinent Shorebird Conservation Initiative. To develop more effective conservation strategies for this species, a more holistic understanding of their habitat requirements across their migratory pathway is critical. Habitat use by these cryptic birds is currently based on opportunistic sightings of birds in short stature grasslands or early growth agricultural areas, where they are more easily seen. We synthesized data on vegetation height, crop type, and general habitat type collected from locations visited by satellite-tracked birds within the Central Flyway of the Americas (7 regions across 6 countries). Detecting vegetation height in grasslands is, as of yet, still unfeasible through remote sensing, therefore compilation of bird-driven (not observer driven) ground observations is invaluable to build a better understanding of the habitat requirements of this imperiled species. By summarizing habitat use across their migratory flightpath, we aim to identify patterns among sites, which can then be used to guide future conservation and management for the species.",poster,NA,2023,84
85,How Does Variance in Natural Factors Alter the Hunting Patterns of Mississippi Kites,"The Mississippi Kite (Ictinia mississippiensis) has become a common breeding season resident of urban areas across the southern Great Plains. The species can be found occupying urban parks, school campuses, and residential areas. Several studies have examined aspects of Mississippi kite ecology, such as diet, breeding ecology, and nest sites selection. However, their daily activity budget remains poorly understood. To gain a better understanding of kite behavior, we constructed a behavioral ethogram and recorded kite activities over 10-min observation periods. During each observation period, we recorded activities for a randomly selected kite. Primary recorded behaviors were ‘perched’ and ‘flight’. We recorded locations (e.g., tree, power line) and activities (e.g., stationary, preen) of perched kites as secondary behaviors. We estimated heights of kites in flight categorically as ‘low’ (≤ 25 m), ‘high’ (25 – 75 m), and ‘soar’ (> 75 m). We conducted 175 observation periods, all in parks in Lubbock, Texas, from 26 June to 24 August 2022. During our observations, we recorded kites as perched 13.0% of the time and in flight 87.0% of the time. The majority of kite flights were at soaring heights (48.1%), with low (25.0%) and high (26.9%) occurring in similar proportions. We are currently conducting regression analysis to identify any relationships between flight heights and time of day, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover.",poster,NA,2023,85
86,Body Weight of Small Vertebrates Across a Gradient of Plant Invasion and Habitat,"Invasive and non-native vegetation can result in reduced ecosystem function presumably due to the loss of native plant diversity. Historically, open rangelands of southern Texas have been invaded by non-native grasses and native, woody shrubs. Small vertebrates play vital roles in ecosystems as primary and secondary consumers; however, little is known of their response to invasive vegetation. To evaluate the effects of invasive vegetation on small vertebrates, we surveyed small mammal and herpetofauna communities at the Welder Wildlife Refuge in San Patricio County, Texas. In December 2019, we established six plots: two consisted of native vegetation, two consisted of invasive vegetation, and two intermediate plots. As of August 2023, we recorded 419 captures of 30 reptile species and 2,331 captures of 11 small mammal species. To determine the potential effects of invasive vegetation on these communities, we compared body weight of each species between each plot. For our three small mammal species, responses differed by species but weights were generally heaviest in invaded and intermediate plots. For our five most commonly captured reptile species Crotalus atrox was significantly heavier in the invaded plots. The other species showed no significant responses to plot type (i.e., level of invasion). Invaded and intermediate plots consisted of woody shrubs that may provide more cover and additional food resources for small mammals resulting in heavier individuals. Similarly, C. atrox prey on small mammals, so larger prey likely results in larger individuals. Thus, these plant communities can be advantageous to certain small vertebrates.",poster,NA,2023,86
87,Whitebrush (Aloysia gratissima) Ecology and Control Options for Management,"Management of shrub populations has been a common practice on South Texas rangelands since the early 1800’s. Increases in woody plant presence in historically herbaceous communities alters the structure and function of the landscape resulting in a loss of ecosystem services. Decreases in forage production and game habitat are frequent consequences of shrub encroachment that influence landowners to implement management strategies. Prior knowledge of ecological site and species characteristics can assist in designing targeted strategies with long term, high control outcomes. Whitebrush (Aloysia gratissima) is a native shrub in South Texas that exhibits locally invasive behavior, forming monoculture stands that often require intensive management. Our goal was to create a site and species-specific management strategy for whitebrush in South Texas by 1) trialing common and newly released chemical control methods and 2) observing the reproductive ecology. We conducted an efficacy trial of a recently released herbicide that resulted in a high level of control regardless of season of application. In addition, four widely used herbicides were applied during the dormant season with increased surfactant rates to evaluate efficacy of nontraditional seasonal applications. While surfactant rate was not found to influence mortality, herbicide and application rate were highly significant (p = 1.224x10-4, 3.267x10-14). Seed ecology characteristics, evaluated through laboratory and greenhouse experiments to further our understanding of the lifetime of management effects, indicated low to moderate levels of seed viability (6-49%) and low germination (4-24%). Results from this study will help determine an effective treatment standard to benefit land managers of South Texas rangelands.",poster,NA,2023,87
88,Weather Effects on Herpetofauna Detection on a South Texas Rangeland,"Worldwide, herpetofaunal species are declining due to factors such as habitat conversion, disease, and climate change. Monitoring herpetofauna populations can be difficult due to the cryptic nature of many species and effort associated with long-term monitoring programs. To maximize surveying efforts, researchers need to understand both where and when to conduct surveys. South Texas has a semiarid climate that experiences frequent drought cycles, which can alter available resources and habitat conditions. In May 2020, we began monitoring herpetofauna communities at the Welder Wildlife Refuge in San Patricio County using drift fence arrays at six plots. These plots were chosen as part of a companion study evaluating the effects of invasive vegetation on herpetofaunal communities. As of August 2022, we recorded 6310 captures of 11 amphibian species and 419 captures of 30 reptile species. We evaluated effects of temperature and rainfall on detection probability for 6 anuran and 5 snake species. For the anuran species, detection probability increased with an increase in rainfall and a decrease in maximum temperature for most species. For the snake species, effects of both rainfall and temperature differed by species. Detection probability increased with a decrease in rainfall and maximum temperature for 3 species, while no differences were observed in detection probability for the remaining snake species. Our results provide researchers more information about the conditions that provide the greatest probability of detection for herpetofauna species. We plan to continue to survey these communities in 2023 to further evaluate effects of weather and vegetation on herpetofauna.",poster,NA,2023,88
89,Mating mystery: A closer look at the breeding ecology of the Painted Bunting,"The Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris) is considered a “species of conservation concern” by the US Fish and Wildlife Service due to persistent population declines. The mating system of the species remains poorly understood and is described as both monogamous and polygynous with anecdotal evidence as support. Based on the limited amount of parental care provided by the male of the species and previously collected female home range data, we suspect female Painted Buntings are mating with more than one male. The aim of this study is to accurately define the mating system of Painted Buntings in North Texas. Using whole genome sequencing via barcoding, we will identify 30-50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for use in a genetic paternity analysis. During the 2022 season, we collected data on 6 nests and genetic samples were collected from 17 nestlings and 2 nonviable eggs. Since 2017, we have collected blood samples from 464 adult and juvenile buntings in our study area. We expect that most broods will be fathered by more than one male. When developing future conservation strategies for this species, it is essential to understand the role that multiple paternity may play on population dynamics, natural evolutionary processes, and the effective population size of Painted Buntings.",poster,NA,2023,89
90,Development of an Improved Survey Method for the Texas Kangaroo Rat (Dipodomys,"The Texas kangaroo rat (Dipodomys elator) currently inhabits five counties in Texas. Habitat fragmentation and changing vegetation patterns are believed to be responsible for the reduction of the population such that it is currently a state threatened species under petition for federal protection. The species rarity and nocturnal activity periods result in them being difficult to survey, monitor, and study. We are testing different approaches to develop a repeatable and reliable survey method for these elusive animals. Our experimental approach consists of employing and comparing a variety of survey methods along ten 1.6 km transects located at the Matador Wildlife Management Area. We are using the substantively more abundant Ord’s kangaroo rat (D. ordii) as a proxy for Texas kangaroo rats, as the two species are very similar, with the main differences being slight pelage differences and choices of soil types. Our survey trials consist of walking spotlight transects, driving spotlight transects, walking thermal scope transects, driving thermal scope transects, and burrow surveys. We are assessing methods on basis of detection probabilities with covariates of moon phase, time, temperature, and cloud cover. Our results should provide guidance to optimize survey methods for Texas kangaroo rats, and serve to facilitate improved surveys and monitoring of this elusive species.",poster,NA,2023,90
91,Assessing the Impacts of Waterfowl Habitat Management in the Western Gulf Coast,"The Texas Coast is one of the most important wintering regions for many waterfowl species, offering high-energy foraging habitat that is crucial during late winter, particularly for migratory species. Since the 1990s, the Gulf Coast Joint Venture (GCJV) has worked to provide foraging habitat for waterfowl species under the Texas Prairie Wetlands Project (TPWP). However, there is no assessment on whether TPWP management is benefitting waterfowl and meeting their objectives in providing important foraging habitat. The aim of this research is to investigate the influence of GCJV habitat management on female northern pintail (Anas acuta; hereafter pintail) during spring migration. The pintail is an excellent model for this study given they demonstrate high winter site fidelity and is a species of concern for management. The objectives are to link the use of the TPWP program sites during late winter to spring migration performance. Female pintails were captured in late winter throughout the Texas Mid-Coast. Females were fitted with Ornitela 15g GPS/GSM transmitters. We will calculate the proportional use of TPWP enrolled sites and link this to (1) date of spring migration departure, (2) number of spring migration stopovers, and (3) date of arrival on breeding areas. We will use a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to determine the effect of proportion of time on TPWP sites on the three spring migration metrics. We expect to provide insight into the relative contribution of the TPWP sites to pintail late winter ecology and spring migratory performance.",poster,NA,2023,91
92,Spatial and temporal variation in mammal communities of a unique forest ecosystem in,"Rising above the pine forests of the Gulf Coastal plain on iron ore mountain tops, upland deciduous forests were once a common cover type in northeast Texas. However, unsustainable logging practices in the early 1900’s, along with changing land-use practices (i.e., fire suppression, monocultural silviculture) have led to a decline of these unique uplands. Because habitat features within these uplands are scarce upon the landscape, habitat features therein could provide important resources for wildlife. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal activity of mammal communities across cover types in northeast Texas. Campak 1080P trail cameras (n =18) were deployed across three cover types (i.e., upland deciduous forest, mixed slope forest, bottomland hardwood forest) from June 2022 to January 2023 at Couch Mountain Ranch in Camp County, TX. We also collected habitat data describing forest structure at each camera location. Based on these data, we determined detection probabilities for all recorded taxa and compared activity across cover types. We observed a general pattern in which increased detections of feral hogs (Sus scrofa) corresponded with decreased detections of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and other mesocarnivores. Furthermore, we observed recognizable shifts in activity among the mesocarnivore guilds. This study contributes to our knowledge of mammal communities in an understudied and unique ecosystem in northeast Texas. Given the drastic alterations that have occurred within upland deciduous forest of the region, wildlife managers will benefit from future studies that focus on understanding how communities may respond to varied forms of land-use and/or forest management.",poster,NA,2023,92
93,Vegetation Selection and Activity Patterns by South Texas Bats,"Bats have a greater diversity of behavior than any other mammalian order. Therefore, understanding activity patterns and vegetation selection is imperative in the success of maintaining bat populations in south Texas. In more recent studies, conducted on the San Antonio Viejo Ranch (SAV) belonging to the East Foundation, activity patterns for four summer resident bats was conducted - Eastern Red Bat (Lasirius borealis), Cave Myotis (Myotis velifer), Evening Bat (Nycticeius humeralis), and Brazilian Free-tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis). These results showed peak nightly activity hours for these bats. For all species included in the study, total bat activity peaked at 02:00, with a secondary peak occurring between 05:00 and 06:00. My results conducted at the El Sauz Ranch, roughly 100 miles southeast of SAV, concurred with this study with a few differences. It is crucial to determine how bats respond to changes in vegetation type and species composition given different land uses. From this, we can understand and provide a baseline for activity patterns and add the information of vegetation selection for these south Texas bats to prepare for future disturbances. This lack of information has led me to research effective management strategies needed to protect these vital species in a more comprehensive and cohesive manner than previously understood. This discussion will also cover a review of current literature and gaps in knowledge.",poster,NA,2023,93
94,Applying eDNA Analysis to Identify Winter Food Habits of American Kestrels in the,"The American kestrel (Falco sparverius) is generalist predator that inhabits open spaces across most of North and South America. Despite their abundance, kestrel populations are in decline across their ranges overall. Previous food habit studies have been conducted during the spring and breeding season, but few studies describe kestrel food habits in the winter. Several studies suggest kestrels prey heavily on invertebrates or reptiles, but these ectothermic animals are inactive and likely unavailable in cold winter months. Sampling for residual eDNA from prey on kestrel beaks could lead to a more complete understanding of food habits for this species, and its role as a predator in ecological communities. During winter of 2021-2022, we captured 49 American kestrels in the Southern High Plains and collected eDNA samples by swabbing their beaks for residual eDNA. DNA was extracted from these samples in collaboration with project collaborators at UC Davis in California. The sequencing process is still ongoing, and we plan to collect another 50 samples in winter 2022-2023. We will assess winter food habits to identify prey species composition and possible prey partitioning between the sexes of this sexual-size dimorphic species.",poster,NA,2023,94
95,Microclimate Characteristics of White-tailed Hawk Nests in South Texas,"The white-tailed hawk (Geranoaetus albicaudatus) is listed as state threatened in Texas, where they breed in open areas throughout the coastal bend region of Texas. Previous research has indicated that anthropogenic activities may have a negative impact on white-tailed hawk breeding activities, and investigating aspects of their breeding ecology will help further management for this threatened species. To date, there is no information available regarding the microclimate of white-tailed hawk nests during the breeding season. Environmental conditions are important drivers for many species' ecological characteristics. Although adult Accipitriformes can respond to fluctuating conditions by changing their activity patterns, nestlings have very limited abilities to do so. However, the microclimate of the nest, as well as parental behavior, can help ameliorate the influences of extreme environmental conditions. A component of our research efforts is to assess the microclimate of white-tailed hawk nests posthatch by use of data loggers that collect temperature and humidity data. Temperature data was also collected in combination with nest cameras used to monitor white-tailed hawk nests in south Texas. Results from the assessment of microclimate data and environmental conditions from 4 white-tailed hawk nesting pairs will be presented.",poster,NA,2023,95
96,Parental Budgets and Feeding Behavior of Nestling White-tailed Hawks,"Members of the Accipitriformes usually have sexually divided parental roles in which the female contributes more to nestling care and nest defense whereas the male provides the majority of food and defends the larger territory. The white-tailed hawk (Geranoaetus albicaudatus) is one of North America’s least studied birds of prey, and little quantitative information is available regarding parental care and feeding behavior during the breeding season, although we hypothesize white-tailed hawks divide parental roles similar to other Accipitriformes. One goal of this study is to describe the sex-specific differences or similarities of nesting white-tailed hawks in context of behavioral budgets related to feeding of nestlings. To determine the behavioral budgets, we placed trail cameras at 12 white-tailed hawk nests containing hatchlings throughout south Texas properties in spring 2021. Cameras were set to take 60 seconds of video whenever they were triggered by movement, with a 60-second pause between triggers. Cameras were active 24 hours per day and ran from 14 April to 3 July 2021. We are assessing relationships of nestling age with adult attendance and feeding frequency, and contrasting nest attendance by male and female members of pairs. Analyses are ongoing and results will be presented from 4 nesting pairs of white-tailed hawks.",poster,NA,2023,96
97,Tricolored Bats in Texas: Acoustic Monitoring to Inform Conservation in the Era of,"Cave-roosting bat species have suffered significant population losses across the U.S. from white-nose syndrome (WNS), a deadly disease caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans that thrives in cave microclimates. The tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) has experienced serious population-level declines due to WNS in portions of their range. While fatalities of P. subflavus from WNS have not been documented to date in Texas, this species is likely to be protected across the U.S. as it was recommended for listing as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in September 2022. Understanding of the Texas population of P. subflavus is limited, and information about distribution, seasonal population movement and fluctuation, and habitat selection is needed to inform management practices. Our objective is to assess the influence of landscape variables on the occupancy probability of P. subflavus across the state of Texas using stationary acoustic monitoring at 96 sites continuously from 2020-2023. Seasonal data will be assessed from four, 4-day periods per year and we will use habitat type (barren, water, cultivated, developed, forest, grassland) at three spatial scales and karst proximity as covariates. Preliminary results from summer 2021 from 82 detectors indicate that P. subflavus occupancy probability increases from 53% to 93% as longitude increases across Texas, with a naïve occupancy of 63% throughout the state. Elevation and latitude were not significant. We will incorporate landscape data into future dynamic and multi-species occupancy models to further examine the critical regions and habitat needed to manage and conserve species at risk from",poster,NA,2023,97
98,Native Grassland Restoration in the Edwards Plateau Ecological Region of Texas,"Developing successful restoration techniques for native plant communities in disturbed landscapes is critical for conservation of rapidly-changing biomes globally. Restoring native grasslands is desired because grasslands have experienced great declines in their historic distribution worldwide. Although region-specific restoration techniques exist throughout the North American Great Plains, there has been limited research in the Edwards Plateau Ecological Region of Texas, where semi-arid rangelands have experienced decades of degradation and loss of native herbaceous vegetation communities. In this research, combinations of commonly used restoration techniques were tested to assess their efficacy for restoring native grassland vegetation in retired agricultural fields in Menard County, Texas, USA. Seventy-two 0.04 ha experimental units were randomly assigned one of two site preparation treatments (disking or control), one of three native seed mix treatments (high diversity [27 species], low diversity [9 species], or control), and one of two herbicide application treatments (glyphosate [Roundup PowerMAX® II Herbicide applied at 1.68 kg active ingredient/ha] or control) using a split-splitplot arrangement of factors. Experimental units were monitored in permanent quadrats where plant species composition and density were measured during the spring and fall seasons for two years (2021-2022). Eighteen seeded species were recorded during the first three sampling periods. Current data suggest the addition of either native seed mix has not increased seeded species density (0.49 plants/0.25 m2) beyond what the seed bank offered in the controls (0.50 plants/0.25 m2). This study aimed to provide region-specific restoration methodology recommendations for disturbed lands in the Edwards Plateau Ecological Region of Texas.",poster,NA,2023,98
99,Species-specific Patterns of Consumption of Oral Rabies Vaccine Baits in the South,"Oral Rabies Vaccine (ORV) baits have been aerially dropped along the US-Mexico border since 1995 for canine rabies. However, there is little information on the fate of baits when they are on the landscape. Our goal is to determine what species are consuming with ORV baits in the South Texas Plains. We used ArcGIS to generate eight 1 km2 grids with 18 camera trap sites in each grid. We hand applied one bait per camera trap for two grids during each application trip. We collected camera data from 144 different sites for four consecutive weeks during each of the four calendar seasons on the East Foundation’s San Antonio Viejo Ranch. We will determine species-specific consumption of ORV baits, and how other factors, such as season may affect consumption patterns. We will generate competing a set of competing models and use Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to determine which model best explains specific-specific patterns of bait use among those considered. We will evaluate how temperature, distance to water, season, and species impacts ORV bait consumption. We will then run an analysis of variance to determine if the relationship between the variables is significant. We predict that species and season will affect ORV bait consumption. The results from this study will help better inform ORV management practices for future ORV aerial drops.",poster,NA,2023,99
100,Composition of the mammalian community at the Stephen F. Austin Experimental,"Camera trap surveys have been used extensively for inventorying wildlife and are particularly valuable for long-term monitoring. Our goal is to assess the temporal dynamics of a mammalian community under the influence of changing management applications. The Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest, located in the Pineywoods ecoregion of Texas, is used for silvicultural and wildlife research. Management of the Experimental Forest has incorporated treatments, such as thinning and prescribed fire, but these treatments have been applied infrequently. Future management applications include a timber harvest and a more frequent fire return interval. We collected camera trap data on the mammalian community during the fall of 2019 to 2022. Twenty-two trail cameras were installed at intervals ≥ 200 meters and were deployed for ~19 days to accumulate no fewer than 400 trap nights. These data were utilized to evaluate the community dynamics, including the effective number of species, rank abundance curves, and species composition. Species diversity was similar across years. Those species observed yearly included the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), wild pig (Sus scrofa), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), coyote (Canis latrans), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana). Based on additional statistical analyses, our results will serve as the baseline of the mammalian community and will allow us to observe any trends or shifts in the community dynamics with changing management applications. Testing different treatments of forest management allows us to provide quality information that is useful for decision-making plans.",poster,NA,2023,100
101,Rangewide Genetic Diversity of the Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido),"Genetic diversity is important to the health of wildlife populations but is being lost for many species due to declines in the number of individuals and loss of connectivity. The Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) is a lek-mating grouse whose population and range have contracted greatly since the beginning of the 20th century due to agriculture and other anthropogenic land uses. In collaboration with several state and federal agencies we collected lek feathers and tissue from across four states for use in an analysis of range-wide genetic diversity and population structure using microsatellite loci. We found that genetic diversity across the range remains relatively high (HE=0.832 versus HO=0.698). In addition, we found moderate evidence of genetic structure linked to each state. Future landscape genetic analysis will expand the number of loci used and link observed population structure to landscape attributes to support management.",poster,NA,2023,101
102,Evaluating the Effectiveness of Redesigned Wildlife Exits Along a South Texas,"Roadside exclusion fencing is commonly used to mitigate wildlife road mortalities as well as property damages caused by wildlife-vehicle collisions. A potentially lethal effect of exclusion fencing is that animals may become trapped on the roadside of the fence and unable to leave the right-of-way. On State Highway 100 in Cameron County, Texas, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) modified segments of fencing to install ten wildlife exits as a solution that would allow animals to escape the roadway by exiting through a modified opening in the fence. However, in the initial design, some individuals learned to use the wildlife exits in reverse to enter the roadway within a year. In this study, a new design of wildlife exit was implemented, with narrower openings, a steep ramp and a clear plastic one-way door. The objectives of this study were to: 1) compare the effectiveness of the two new designs, 2) compare the effectiveness of the new designs to the old design, and 3) compare the percentages of animals that escape the roadway using the wildlife exits by study period. These new wildlife exits were monitored using camera traps, including a video camera attached to an infrared trip wire sensor to capture wildlife interactions with the new wildlife exits. Effectiveness of designs were compared using t-tests and an analysis of variance was used to compare overall use of the wildlife exits by study period. This study will provide insights into wildlife use of exits and help to guide future designs.",poster,NA,2023,102
103,A Comparison of Avian Sampling Methodologies: Is Species Richness Accurately,"Different avian sampling methods obtain biases, which act as filters, such as the ability to capture aural species over cryptic species. Therefore, the need for choosing a suitable sampling method or set of methods, in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness, is essential. The ability to choose a suitable sampling method is critical to obtaining accurate community and population data, whilst considering the project objectives, budget, and personnel. Utilizing the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol, mist-netting, and point count survey data, we compared the effectiveness of each sampling method in detecting a complete avian community, with consideration of implications for monitoring programs, allocation of limited resources, and time to detection. Our study site is a riparian deciduous woodland along the Aransas River, on the Welder Wildlife Refuge, located in the Central Flyway migration corridor. Interpolation and extrapolation (iNEXT) analysis (0D) revealed variation in species diversity for each sampling method. MAPS observed the largest species diversity, whereas mistnets observed the least amount. However, point count surveys observed the largest number of individuals. We found significant differences (PERMANOVA, Pseudo-F=(2,26); p=0.001*) in community composition between methodologies. A total of 62 species were detected: 3 unique species observed through MAPS, and 8 unique species observed through point counts; 16 species observed through MAPS but not captured; 21 species observed through MAPS and point counts but not captured in nets; and 14 species observed through all methods. Depending on project goals and resources, a combination of methodologies would best capture a complete avian community.",poster,NA,2023,103
104,Forecasting Spatial Abundance of Northern Bobwhite in South Texas Using Roadside,"Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) is a popular game bird experiencing population declines. Given that bobwhites are subject to harvest, having reliable measures of population abundance is important for proper management and conservation of the species. Currently, many landowners rely on general population trends at the regional level or on local, anecdotal observations to assess the quality of the upcoming hunting season and plan harvest. The purpose of our research is to develop a more precise and finer-scale estimate of bobwhite relative abundance that may be used by landowners to help forecast the quail season at a regional extent in south Texas. Specifically, our objectives are to quantify the relationship between bobwhite relative abundance, landscape characteristics, and rainfall to annually develop a spatial map of bobwhite relative abundance. We conducted quail roadside surveys during August– September 2022 across 13 sites in south Texas and quantified landscape composition and structure (percent cover of rangeland, urban, water, other; mean rangeland patch size, mean Euclidean distance) and rainfall within a 25-km buffer of each route. We used linear regression to evaluate the influence of landscape characteristics and rainfall on bobwhite relative abundance and used this relationship to develop a spatial map of bobwhite relative abundance. Such a predictive map of bobwhite abundance can be a helpful tool to annually assist landowners in forecasting the upcoming hunting season and better plan harvest.",poster,NA,2023,104
105,Single-species management and its effect on small mammal biodiversity,"Heterogeneous landscapes provide habitats for a variety of different organisms and are important habitats for maintenance of biodiversity. Single-species management strategies can have both direct and indirect benefits for non-target organisms. We are investigating how management aimed at target species influences non-target species biodiversity at Government Canyon State Natural Area, San Antonio, Texas. The oak-juniper shrubland habitat serves as a breeding site for a variety of migratory songbirds, including the target species Black-capped vireos (Vireo atricapilla). Active management will be necessary to maintain the habitat. Prior to management actions, small mammal biodiversity has been monitored across different habitat types, using live trapping methods, twice monthly. Species were identified using morphological characteristics, and standard mark-recapture techniques were used. A total of 1311 traps were set over 11 trap nights, with an overall trap success of 8.2% (107/1311). 57.9% (62/107) of captures were new captures, and 55.5% (30/54) of these individuals were female. Low biodiversity was observed with a total of 94.4% (51/54) of all captures representing Peromyscus lacieanus; 3.4% (2/54) Peromyscus leucopus, and 1.9% (1/54) Reithrodontomys fulvescens, respectively. Our findings suggest seasonal changes in movement patterns, and small sub-populations throughout the site. The low observed biodiversity suggests larger scale landscape characteristics may be more important to explaining biodiversity. Investigation of high human use areas is underway to provide more meaningful management plans. Species conservation requires a holistic perspective of the effects of management techniques on biodiversity as a whole.",poster,NA,2023,105
106,Comparing Precision and Scale-Transferability of Rangeland Monitoring Methods for,"Rangeland ecosystems make up nearly half of the earth’s land surface. These landscapes provide habitat for various flora and fauna and provide essential ecosystem services. However, anthropogenic activities such as habitat fragmentation and excessive livestock grazing regimes have transformed rangelands into brush-dominated landscapes. The consequences of habitat degradation include loss of wildlife, soil erosion, reduced water harvest, and lower carbon sequestration. Such concerns drive restoration and many monitoring methods exist to measure such efforts. Detecting change from restoration is essential to determine its efficacy. My project aims to compare methods to evaluate the rate of change for brush cover and herbaceous production after restoration efforts. I will use satellite-derived spectral data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration /United States Geological Survey Landsat Program and manual monitoring using established line-intercept transect methods for my brush assessments. This will determine the scales at which Landsat data can capture change in brush communities with an equal or greater degree of precision than industry-standard manual monitoring. For herbaceous plant production, I will compare remotely sensed data from Landsat and fine-scale spectral data to manual quadrat sampling. My analysis will also determine gains per unit cost (in terms of hours and dollars per change in unit of precision). Determining which methods are most efficient for assessing change rates following restoration in these landscapes will assist stakeholders in planning and implementing grassland restoration in the region.",poster,NA,2023,106
107,Common Forbs of the Trans-Pecos: A Field and Lab Guide,"The Trans-Pecos region of Texas is one of the most diverse ecoregions in the world. However, for plants, the rich diversity makes it highly challenging to identify different species. Stochasticity in climate, and plant growth patterns, combined add to the difficulty of understanding the region's diverse flora. The primary purpose of this work is to provide descriptions and pictures that aid in the identification of common forb species in the field and on a cellular level. Additionally, we aim to provide reference material and bridge a gap between the biological world and the natural resource management profession. When conducting vegetative monitoring, it is common to find specimens that are nearly impossible to identify due to a lack of distinguishing characteristics. The same case arises when conducting dietary work. Plant material that has been mechanically masticated and chemically digested showcases no standard structural properties. Using scraped or ground samples that mimic digestive processes, we identify the defining characteristics of the dermal tissue structure and shape. These descriptions can then be utilized as a reference to identify partial cellular structures in fecal samples, stomach contents, or unidentifiable “twigs” collected in the field. The project also explains the functional livestock and wildlife value of flora. Correct identification and knowledge of a plant species can be used in the lab and everyday settings. The text is a collection of general knowledge, personal observations, and working science from many peer-reviewed resources brought together to help aid botanical studies in the Trans-Pecos region.",poster,NA,2023,107
108,Measuring water and nutrients in rangeland grass species: What can we learn from,"Water plays a vital role for native rangeland species. Water absence causes stomata closure in which will result in the reduction of water loss and a decline in the leaves' photosynthetic rate. Limited water availability within plant species will have a negative effect on plant diversity, animal nutrition, and overall native plant health. Having little to no diversity within plant species will decrease the overall nutritional value at the pasture scale. Wildlife and livestock will compete for water and readily available native species in order to meet their nutritional requirements. Our goal is to use multispectral sensors on drones to monitor rangeland species and their spectral reflectance differences under different moisture conditions. Our objectives are (1) to quantify the relationship between water and spectral signature in native grasses using multispectral imagery from drones, (2) evaluate the spectral signatures of native species to determine nutrient content of native plants. To achieve our objectives, we plan to fly drones at an altitude of 50 m above ground level and acquire multispectral imagery. Flights will be at the Texas Native Seeds fields at Texas A&M University- Kingsville. We will place soil and leaf moisture sensors to compare field collected data and aerial imagery. We will take grass samples and analyze their nutrient content to determine the relationship between nutrients and reflectance values. This study will provide new insights to assess the relationship between soil moisture, nutrition content, leaf moisture, and reflectance values from native grasses in South Texas.",poster,NA,2023,108
109,"Histological Analysis of Desert Bighorn Sheep, Aoudad, and Mule Deer Diets in the Van","Since the introduction of aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) in West Texas, suspicions have been raised concerning the effects that they may have on native desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). If competition among the species is present, diet is just one possible component that may be impacted. The goal of this project was to measure the diet composition of desert bighorn sheep, aoudad, and mule deer in the Van Horn Mountains, TX, through histological analysis. Within a co-occupied landscape, 5 fecal samples were collected for each species each month for a year. Fecal samples were dried, ground, bleached, and mounted on slides. Three cover slips were prepared per slide, and 6 transects were run per coverslip. Identifiable cell structures were photographed. Currently, we are identifying cell fragments to the genus or species level by comparing photos to an existing reference library. Though the results are not final, we have found an unexpected amount of grass in desert bighorn samples. We frequently observed woody plants which include grey oak (Quercus grisea) and Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa). In addition, cacti and succulents such as prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), tasajillo (Cylindropuntia leptocaulis), ephedra (Ephedra spp.), and yucca (Yucca spp.) have occurred consistently throughout the diets of all three species. Once data has been compiled, we hope to estimate the degree of dietary overlap to contribute to the larger question of whether aoudad, desert bighorn, and mule deer significantly impact each other.",poster,NA,2023,109
110,Understanding the Diet of an Unmanaged Population of Coyotes in Southern Texas,"Diet of a species is integral knowledge in planning wildlife management. Predator selection of prey items can strongly influence the population dynamics of other wildlife, as well as food availability for those species. One such species is the coyote (Canis latrans), whose great dietary plasticity may lead to variability in their impacts on other species. Although coyote diet has been well-studied throughout their range, what is less well known is the diet of coyote populations in the absence of human intervention on native wildlife populations. As larger rangelands cease active management of coyotes, managers interested in mitigating damage on other wildlife and livestock must understand coyote diet in the scope of a less-managed system. Therefore, our project aims to compare the diet of an unmanaged coyote population in South Texas to populations who experience human intervention, including management, harvest, trapping, and supplemental feeding. We collected coyote scat from 20 one-kilometer long transects on the roads of the East Foundation’s San Antonio Viejo Ranch once per month for a year. We recorded GPS location, placement on the road, substrate type, road development, and size dimensions. We identified morphologically and analyzed prey items using relative volume based on an intercept grid system. We predict that there will be a difference between diets due to the unmanaged population exhibiting natural activity patterns as well as older age structures. This will lend insight into the management of this species on South Texas rangelands and beyond.",poster,NA,2023,110
111,Comparing two detection methods for estimating occupancy of chestnut-bellied scaled,"Animal behavior is a complex amalgamation of actions structured by physical and social environments and can influence the success of animal monitoring strategies by altering important parameters such as detection rates. The likelihood of a bird calling may be density dependent, and in areas of low occupancy birds may not call because the risks of announcing its presence may outweigh the benefits of conspecific communication. In turn, passive observation methods (point counts) may underestimate occupancy. Playback surveys provide an auditory stimulus intended to increase detection and may perform better than point counts. Our objective was to test the effectiveness of point count and playback surveys for detecting chestnut-bellied scaled quail (Callipepla squamata castanogastris; hereafter “scaled quail”). Between 17 May and 28 June 2022, we conducted 1020-point count and scaled quail playback surveys at two study sites in Dimmit and Duval Counties, Texas. Observers performed a five-minute point count, followed by a two-minute period where scaled quail calls were broadcasted and scaled quail detections were recorded. We detected scaled quail during 16.8% (±2.6%) of point count surveys, and detections increased to 28.5% (±2.7%, p<0.001) after inclusion of playback responses. Continued research will test the impact of vegetation cover on scaled quail occupancy, and determine if the effectiveness of playback surveys differs between vegetation types. If playbacks increase detection rates by a greater magnitude in areas of lower overall occupancy, it could have implications for population monitoring in areas of suboptimal but usable space.",poster,NA,2023,111
112,"Winter Habitat Selection, Movement and Survival of Scaled Quail in the Trans-Pecos,","Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) have experienced population declines across their range in the last several decades. This population decline is partially attributed to habitat degradation, as habitat loss reduces scaled quail’s useable resources for food, water, and shelter. This becomes critical during the winter season in the Trans-Pecos, where lower food availability and cold weather make habitat resources essential for withstanding winter weather events. In addition, juvenile recruitment and available brood stock for the following nesting season are negatively affected by winter mortality, making winter a potentially influential period for scaled quail populations. Monitoring daily cycles in scaled quail habitat selection and movement allows us to observe how scaled quail respond to winter conditions, such as changes in movement patterns, selection of thermal refuges, and vulnerability to mortality. Our study seeks to describe these dynamics to supply knowledge on this understudied seasonal aspect of scaled quail ecology. We will trap quail in southern Brewster County, Texas during the winters of 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 using walk-in funnel traps and fit them with aluminum leg bands and Global Positioning System backpacks to obtain location data and monitor survival across the winter season. Location data will be analyzed using an integrated Step Selection Analysis to identify scaled quail’s selection and movement behaviors throughout the winter. Examining individual variation in these dynamics will help identify habitat attributes and movement behaviors conducive to greater individual fitness, thereby better informing future management efforts for scaled quail in the Trans-Pecos.",poster,NA,2023,112
113,Ecohydrology Improvements and an Evaluation of the Performance of Native Grasses,"The decline of scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) populations has been mainly attributed to habitat degradation. Increasing plant diversity and reducing soil erosion may help alleviate this problem.Therefore, we have deployed a holistic strategy to restore riparian habitat within the Chihuahuan Desert based on building structures known as “trincheras” and reseeding native vegetation to improve hydrological processes to establish native plants. We expect restoration efforts to increase water harvest, reduce soil erosion, increase native vegetation, and positively affect scaled quail by increasing cover and food availability. Restoration efforts began in August of 2021, in a private ranch in Southern Brewster County. To date, we have built 130. Of those, 50 are being assessed before and after the rainy season (May – October 2022) to measure how much soil these structures are trapping and changes in the vegetation structure and plant cover. Simultaneously we have been assessing the performance of different native grass species in a greenhouse with 4 different grass species (bristlegrass [Setaria vulpiseta], sideoats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula], whiplash pappusgrass [Pappopharum vaginatum], and blue grama [Bouteloua gracilis]) as a first trial to identify best native grasses to seed in trincheras. Also, these 4 groups were divided into another 4 groups representing different rainfall rates: 2 inches, 4 inches, 6 inches, and 8 inches. This allowed us to assess the seed germination response for each grass species. Preliminary results indicate that trincheras increase soil retention and that Bouteloua gracilis and Bouteloua curtipendula have better outcomes than the other 2 species.",poster,NA,2023,113
114,Developing a Large-Scale Virtual Fencing System to Improve Wildlife Habitat,"Virtual fencing in livestock production systems offers cattle ranchers an alternative to physical fences which can be labor intensive, costly, and provide limited flexibility. Current systems utilize collars/ear tags worn by the animal that deliver first an audio cue and electric pulse to alert the animal when coming close to the boundary. Although these systems have been tested at small scales and over short time periods, broad scale study on the application of these systems is needed. Additionally, the possible benefits of such systems for improving wildlife habitat are relatively unknown. Our goal is to develop a system that can be used on large pastures and doesn’t rely on an internet signal. Subsequently, we can evaluate the effectiveness of this system and use remote sensing to learn how vegetation is impacted. We will use a drone to quantify vegetation utilization patterns by modeling vegetation height to monitor changes in structure, and to identify the difference in utilization near the boundary. Additionally, we want to track bobwhite quail locations using VHF drone technology to determine if this expected change in vegetation structure in the virtual enclosure is causing an increase in quail occurrence due to improved habitat. These results will provide more information that is needed before widespread implementation of virtual fencing can occur, and will open more possibilities for managers to implement new grazing regimes, improve wildlife habitat, manipulate vegetation, and overall control animal movement.",poster,NA,2023,114
115,Assessing Amphibian Use of Flooded Wildlife Crossings with eDNA,"Wildlife crossing structures (WCS) are generally designed for use by medium to large mammals. During heavy rains, WCS are likely to flood, deterring use by most mammal species. Many transportation departments look at existing water drainage culverts to modify for dual use as a WCS. WCS are commonly monitored with camera traps, but this method is not reliable for detecting all herpetofauna, especially aquatic and semi-aquatic species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a commonly used non-invasive method for detecting aquatic and semi-aquatic species not easily caught by other survey methods. WCS have been installed along State Highway 100 and farm-to-market 106 to mitigate ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) mortalities in Cameron County Texas. Some of these WCS are prone to occasional flooding (ephemeral) while others have flowing water year-round (flowing) and may be attractants to herpetofauna. Water samples will be collected approximately once a month at WCS with flowing water (n=3) and at all sites two to three days after heavy rain events (n=6), dependent on water presence. Samples will be tested for eDNA through PCR assays and metabarcoding analyses using primers that detect all amphibian species found in Cameron County. PERMANOVA will be run to analyze the effects of water type (flowing or ephemeral) on the amphibian community, and a t-test will compare the total number of species between water type. We hypothesize that the amphibian communities will differ in WCS with flowing and ephemeral water. This data may be useful for management of threatened or endangered amphibians around roadways.",poster,NA,2023,115
116,Habitat and Spatial Factor Underlying Community Organization of Tadpoles in East,"Habitat and spatial factors, as well as species interactions (e.g., predation), can affect the structure and function of populations and communities across landscapes. In this study, we explored how spatial factors, such as regional aquatic habitat breeding size (HS) and distance to the nearest suitable habitat (DH), interact with the presence of top predators and shape anuran diversity patterns in permanent ponds in the Davy Crockett National Forest (Texas). We surveyed larval anuran assemblages across four different top predator regimes (PR) including 1) Largemouth bass (B), 2) Green sunfish (G), 3) a combination of both B and G, and 4) salamander/invertebrate predators (SI). Field surveys were conducted between June 2021 to June 2022. Spatial variables were calculated using in situ pond area and information from pond shapefiles. To quantify the effect of HS, DH, and PR, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with negative binomial distribution was performed using relative abundance or richness separately as response variables and HS, DH, and PR as predictive variables. In total, 11 tadpole species were collected across 20 ponds. The three most relatively abundant species collected were Lithobates clamitans (Bronze frog, n = 4,606), L. sphenocephalus (Leopard frog, n = 3,656), and Dryophytes versicolor (Gray treefrog, n = 1,293). GLM indicated that only DH had a significant positive effect on species' relative abundance (p <0.001). Habitat isolation might enhance the increased relative abundance of highly vagile species on the landscape, possibly due to priority effects in colonizing isolated habitats and subsequent reduction in competition.",poster,NA,2023,116
117,Methods to Increase Native Vegetation in Areas Invaded by Lehmann's Love Grass,"Native and non-native grassland species can negatively interact and compete. Sometimes those negative interactions can affect native species by leading them to eradication, and converting a diverse rangeland into monocultures. This is due to non-native species having aggressive behavior and better response than natives towards drought and wildfires. Also, some non-native plant species are not preferred by wildlife. For example, scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) habitat is indirectly affected by negative interactions with invasive species such as Lehmann Lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana). Therefore, we initiated a restoration project for scaled quail habitat to mitigate Lehmann Lovegrass monocultures and increase native plants for scaled quail. This project was located in Southern Brewster County and is part of the Chihuahua Desert. Our study is designed to find and evaluate ways to decrease and control Lehmann Lovegrass. We established 200 16m2 plots with 4 different treatments. We used 3 line intersections in each plot to compare if there are significant differences between treatments and define which treatments have a better result to decrease and control Lehmann Lovegrass. Treatments are soil disturbance, native plant seeding, soil disturbance and seeding, and a Control. Data was taken before treatments were implemented during the summer of 2022 and post-rainy season in October 2022. Preliminary results indicate that seeding native grasses have the most significant amount of native vegetation within our treatments.",poster,NA,2023,117
118,Texas Tortoise Response to Prescribed Fire in South Texas Coastal Rangelands,"Prescribed fire has become an increasingly popular tool in managing vegetation conditions and can create heterogeneity in vegetation cover and structure. Some wildlife species that utilize both grassy and brushy areas may benefit from the variation in vegetation that fire produces. However, studies examining the effects of fire on herpetofauna are infrequent. Currently, we have found no data on fire effects specific to Texas tortoises (Gopherus berlandieri), which is listed as state threatened in Texas. Though the Texas tortoise may be considered a rather sedentary species with short activity periods, their movement and activity may be closely linked to temperature. This study aims to assess survival and movement of these tortoises through burn events by comparing the movements of tortoises in pastures that experience summer burns, control patches that are not burned, and patches that will be burned in the winter. Additionally, temperature information was collected on the tortoises’ carapaces to examine how tortoise performance is associated with the external temperatures they experience. This study may allow us to determine a season of burning that is directly less lethal to the tortoises and that indirectly supports their populations by providing variation in available vegetation cover and structure. At the end of the study, we may be able to make recommendations to landowners in south Texas on how they can manage their property in a way that also supports conservation of wildlife.",poster,NA,2023,118
119,How are Herbaceous Plant Relationships Affected by Prescribed Fire?,"Much of Texas’ historic rangeland plant composition was shaped by fire, and the removal of fire from rangeland ecosystems has led to compositional changes in vegetation communities. Previous research has examined the effects of prescribed fire on herbaceous vegetation mortality, production, nutritional value, and community composition in coastal southern Texas. However, no study has examined prescribed fire’s effects on nearest neighbor plant relationships in this region. We are evaluating effects of varied return interval and season of burning on nearest neighbor herbaceous plant relationships in the Gulf Prairies and Marshes ecoregion of south Texas. Our objective is to determine how differing prescribed fire regimes affect those relationships. At East Foundation’s El Sauz ranch, sixteen burn units (>200 ha) were randomly assigned a treatment regime beginning in 2016: Summer-short, Summer-long, Wintershort, Winter-long, or Control (no fire). We have established six sampling transects in each burn unit scheduled for treatment between summer 2022 and 2024 to assess the effects on herbaceous plant relationships. Surveys are conducted pre-burn and will be repeated ~6, ~12, ~18, and ~24 months post-burning, with Control units being surveyed concurrently. Using modified step-point transects, we record ground cover at each point, nearest herbaceous plant species to each point, nearest rooted neighboring herbaceous species to that plant, and distance between the two plants. We will determine effects of varied prescribed burning regimes on herbaceous species diversity and spatial relationships among neighboring plants. Our results will help land managers to better create prescribed burning prescriptions to meet specific objectives.",poster,NA,2023,119
120,Pre-restoration Waterbird Surveys at Natural and Man-made Water Sources,"Restoration efforts of landscapes are rarely evaluated for their effect on wildlife or resources. It is important to understand the outcomes of restoration to implement an adaptive approach to management and conservation. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department purchased Palo Pinto Mountain State Park, in Palo Pinto County, TX, USA, in 2011. Since then, the park has expanded to 4,871 ac with the addition of a tract of land that is undergoing restoration efforts. Within the original park, there is one large water source and multiple smaller water sources that are natural features of the landscape. At the restoration site, there are two man-made water sources that will undergo restoration in the future. We are conducting a comparative study of the natural and man-made water sources to examine the effect of restoration on the man-made water sources. We conduct surveys twice a month year-round starting in October 2022 from 30 minutes before sunrise to 1 hour after sunrise. From a concealed location <5 m from the water edge, we record waterbirds located in or near the water source or flying overhead. We record the number of individuals, behavior, and sex. With these observations, we will provide Texas Parks & Wildlife with baseline information on the community and population of waterbirds in the park and inform a plan for restoration around each water source.",poster,NA,2023,120
121,PMSG and Timing Effects on the Follicle Stimulation of Axis Deer During Artificial,"For decades, the deer breeding industry has grown substantially. However, little is known about the reproductive synchronization of Axis does in a confinement setting, and the various timing and hormone usage and its effects on follicle development. This project was designed around the artificial breeding program at a private industry deer breeder in Axis (n=47) does. Treatments were two doses of PMSG (1cc and 1.25cc) and a continuous range of time points from CIDR pull to artificial insemination (58 to 64 hours). On the day of AI, number of follicles (corpus hemoragicum), size of follicles, and uterine score during AI were recorded. All data was collected by the same artificial insemination technician across all deer in this study. All data were analyzed in SAS v9.4 via PROC REG. The overall model was not significant (P = 0.18), and there was no significant effect of PMSG (P = 0.07) or time (P = 0.60) on total follicles. Regarding uterine score, the overall model was not significant (P = 0.91), and there was no significant effect based on PMSG (P = 0.93) or time (P = 0.66). Anecdotally, there was a difference in total follicles based on PMSG. Does that received 1 cc had on average 8 CHs whereas the 1.25cc group had 6 CHs at the time of AI. While these results are not significant, the data collected can be used to improve the knowledge pool in the captive deer breeding industry.",poster,NA,2023,121
122,Distribution Models of Texas Tortoise,"The status of many wildlife species that are potentially rare is a growing concern for conservation agencies. Effective conservation planning warrants an understanding of accurate species distribution. Habitat association of state threatened Texas tortoise Gopherus berlandieri, a Species of Greatest Conservation Need within the state, is largely understudied. However, it is widely accepted that the range of the species is contracting and the population is declining. We downloaded the tortoise sighting data for the past ten years from the global biodiversity information facility. We selected ecologically relevant variables among 19 bioclimatic variables (available on worldclim.org) that may determine the occurrence of the tortoise. We developed ecological niche models using Maximum Entropy approach in Maxent Ver 3.4.4 program. We fit the data to model species distribution using various model settings in the program Maxent. We also collected species occurrence data through field surveys adopting the opportunistic search method in Cameron County in South Texas and used the independent data set for testing our models. We selected the models that had adequate predictive power and revealed an ecologically meaningful relationship between the predictor variables to the species occurrence. The models produced spatially explicit distribution maps of the Texas tortoise Gopherus berlandieri. This study will contribute to the conservation efforts of the declining species population. Our modeling approach can be replicated in the future to monitor the distribution pattern of the species that can influence future management practices for the conservation of Texas tortoise.",poster,NA,2023,122
123,Plant DRIPS—Plant Drought Response and Insect Pollinator Studies: Plant- pollinator,"Interactions between plants and pollinators are of considerable importance to ecosystem health, global biodiversity, and human well-being. Declines in pollinators have been clearly identified with threats such as habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization, intensive agriculture, and climate change. In Texas, climate models suggest increased frequency and severity of drought, which can reduce wild floral resources in areas that are already limited by other factors in the landscape. Identifying plants that provide robust floral resources under environmental stressors can provide guidance on maintaining the integrity of ecosystem services provided in anthropogenic settings. The purpose of this study is to identify perennials that improve pollinator diversity and resource use under projected drought stress for North-Central Texas. We established 12 garden beds (2 m x 14 m) containing 20 species of drought-tolerant perennial plants commonly used in urban landscapes. We conducted weekly observations from May to November 2022 and recorded pollinator visitors during 1-minute observations at each plant. We sampled pollinator abundance in beds and an adjacent plot of native vegetation weekly using a vacuum sampler to obtain baseline community data. Extreme drought conditions persisted for the duration of the growing season and limited native floral resources. Our findings will aid in determining pollinator preference and resource use in urban settings where resources are limited due to drought and other forms of water stress, as well as promoting a suite of robust flowering perennials for consideration in restoration or conservation plantings.",poster,NA,2023,123
124,Golden-cheeked Warbler Lidar Based Habitat Model Tested With Acoustic Recorders,"The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a federally endangered avian species that breeds exclusively in Central Texas. The habitat for the golden-cheeked warbler (GCWA) has been studied extensively and is largely defined as having a closed canopy with a mixture of hardwoods and mature Ashe juniper. The Center for Environmental Management of Military Lands (CEMML) utilized LiDAR data from Joint Base San Antonio, Camp Bullis, Texas from 2020 to create a model of GCWA habitat on base. The final iteration of this model deemed some areas unsuitable based on patch size and distance from suitable habitat. Our study investigated the validity of these exclusions by using both acoustic recorders and traditional point count surveys to assess occupancy. Point counts were conducted during deployment and retrieval of the acoustic recorders at each site (n=33). Audio recorders found GCWA at 64% of the points, indicating that some of the model’s exclusions were inaccurate. Humans detected GCWA at only 12% of the points, suggesting that observer presence could be a limiting factor. Based on our findings the model requires modification to incorporate more GCWA habitat. Habitat is a critical factor for golden-cheeked warblers; refining the parameters of suitable habitat allows DoD natural resources personnel to improve management of military lands for both military training and these endangered species.",poster,NA,2023,124
125,"Occupancy of eastern red bats across Texas, a species highly affected by wind energy","Increasing threats to bats, including the rapid and extensive development of wind energy facilities, call for investigating bat populations. The unintended consequence of wind energy on bat populations is of particular importance in Texas, the leading wind energy producer in the U.S. Wind energy affects many bat species, but three migratory tree-roosting bat species (Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus, Lasionycteris noctivagans) have higher rates of documented fatalities at wind turbines, potentially causing population-level declines. Our objective was to illuminate variables that impact these species’ distribution and movement patterns across space and time. We placed 96 acoustic detectors across Texas, selecting sites according to the North American Bat protocol. We are collecting nightly acoustic calls for three years (2020–2023) and examining seasonal data from four, 4-day periods per year. To date, we have conducted singlespecies hierarchical occupancy models for 82 sites on L. borealis for summer (pre-volancy) 2021 with several weather covariates on the detection process and latitude, longitude, and elevation on the occupancy probability. We detected L. borealis at 48 of the 82 sites across Texas. Results indicate that detection probability increased with temperature and Julian date and decreased with elevation. As the project continues, we will assess the influence of landcover at multiple scales on distribution, migration, movement patterns, and community dynamics. This information can guide management practices such as wind energy siting, wind turbine curtailment, and implementation of ultrasonic acoustic deterrents.",poster,NA,2023,125
126,Evaluation of South Texas Clay Loma Characteristics,"Clay lomas are a unique land feature found in only four counties along the southern coast of Texas. They have not been well-evaluated for plant diversity nor as a wildlife resource. The objective of this project is to quantitatively describe soils and vegetation of lomas. Using maps and descriptions provided by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, we have identified potential loma sites throughout South Texas. We are selecting fifteen sites on various private and public properties to survey over the course of this study: East Foundation’s El Sauz ranch, NextDecade Rio Grande LNG, Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, and the King Ranch Norias Division. Soil samples are collected every 10 meters along two transects on each loma, one aligned in the direction of the prevailing southeast wind and another perpendicular to it. In addition to traversing the loma, each transect extends 100 m from the loma’s edge on both ends. In each unique vegetation community on each loma, 5-m × 5-m plots are established for quantifying vegetation. Species frequency, cover, and density in plots are surveyed using 5 0.25m2 frames. With these data, lomas will be classified into one of three known loma types: Loma Evergreen Shrubland, Loma Deciduous Shrubland, or Loma Grassland. Additionally, previouslyunidentified loma classifications will be created when appropriate. Using soil, landform and vegetation data we will also be able to determine areas where new lomas may be identified. Our results will aid Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in creating conservation management plans for this rare landform.",poster,NA,2023,126
127,Monitoring the Effects of Wildlife Crossings on Bobcat Range in South Texas,"Due to their large home ranges, bobcats (Lynx rufus) are highly susceptible to habitat fragmentation caused by roads. Larger roads serve as territorial boundaries, decreasing the size of their home range, and smaller roads serve as travel lanes and hunting grounds, increasing the risk of road mortality. When present, bobcats use wildlife crossing structures (WCS) to safely travel underneath roadways, decreasing the risk of road mortality. However, it is unclear how WCS affect the home ranges of bobcats living in habitats that are fragmented by roadways. To analyze the utility of WCS in connecting habitat fragmented by a road, bobcats in South Texas will be identified to individual to allow tracking of individual movement based on camera trap data along a roadway. Using camera data from nine WCS on Farm-to-Market Road 106 (FM 106) in Cameron County, Texas, as well as camera data from a study monitoring the habitat adjacent to FM 106, bobcats will be identified to individual to create a database of known bobcats captured by camera traps in these areas. Movement of known bobcats will be tracked and mapped using camera data from July 2021 to May 2022 to provide insight into the use of crossing structures by bobcat individuals present in the habitat near and adjacent to FM 106.",poster,NA,2023,127
128,Examining the Implications of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi on Plant-Pollinator,"Global, long-term studies show a decline in pollinating insect abundance, floral resources, and available habitat for the past 40 years, prompting a need to improve conservation efforts for pollinator-plant relationships at local scales. These relationships are especially vulnerable in grassland ecosystems, which have experienced significant decline globally. Although primarily wind-pollinated, grass conservation is important for pollinator success because grass provides nesting structure, tolerates drought conditions, and grass pollen may provide a supplemental resource for pollinators when other floral resources are limited. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are associated with plant roots, uptaking nutrients and assist’s in priming plant’s for faster defense responses, thereby influencing components of plant reproduction. The purpose of our study is to assess the efficacy of AMF on pollinator communities associated with Texas grasslands by addressing the following objectives: (1) Quantify insect pollinator networks (alpha diversity, composition, and connectivity) associated with native and nonnative grasses, (2) Assess productivity and nutritive value of pollen from a suite of grass species, and (3) Determine the influence of AMF on insect behavior and floral traits. We will consider a complete randomized block design under twelve treatment combinations including mycorrhizal inoculum (soil either treated with mycorrhizae, no treatment, or fungicide), nutrient load, soil water availability to simulate drought, and X species of warm-season perennial grasses. We will sample soil characteristics, secondary metabolite production, pollen chemical composition, and insect pollinator frequency and diversity. We will provide a baseline for understanding aboveground-belowground trophic interactions to improve conservation on pollinating insects in grassland ecosystems.",poster,NA,2023,128
129,Drought Conditions Associated with Available Habitat for Bison at Caprock Canyons,"To increase understanding of range management, it is often helpful to understand how current vegetation conditions have changed in the recent past. Texas Parks & Wildlife (TPWD) founded Caprock Canyon State Park (CCSP) outside of Quitaque, Texas in Briscoe County. In 1997, TPWD introduced 36 southern plains bison (Bison bison bison) to the park. There are currently approximately 350 bison in the 6,070-ha park. Our objective is to examine changes in vegetation since the bison introduction at CCSP to better understand changes over time in available habitat. We use 30-m spatial resolution Landsat imagery freely available in GloVis and USGS databases to obtain normalized difference vegetation index in March of 1991 and 2022. Preliminary analyses suggest a potential decline in vegetation between 1991 and 2009, therefore we are examining the hypothesis that this might be correlated with drought conditions in the area. We will obtain drought indices from the park to examine correlations with vegetation changes. This information will help CCSP biologists understand current habitat conditions and aid in their management plan for the park.",poster,NA,2023,129
130,Effects of canopy cover on habitat and space use by coyotes and gray foxes along,"The coyote (Canis latrans) has become North America's most widespread canid, likely due to being a habitat generalist and able to live in close proximity to human settlement. Gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) are widely distributed across North America. However, extensive analysis of the species' general ecology and population dynamics is lacking. My study aims to increase the fundamental understanding of gray fox habitat use and species occurrence, as well as examine how coyotes have expanded their niche to utilize both the forested and human-altered landscapes that vastly contrast with their historical habitat of open plains and prairies. My research will consist of a two-part camera trapping study with canopy cover and impervious surface as predictors of coyote and gray fox occurrence throughout the United States. Part I of my project will emphasize a nationwide study on an urban-rural gradient. Part II will focus on a local analysis of occurrence using data from the greater Austin, Texas, area. Data on species occurrence will be obtained from camera traps deployed by various wildlife monitoring programs across the United States. In ArcGIS, buffer zones at 300, 600, and 1200 m will be established at each camera location, and mean percent canopy cover and impervious surface will be obtained from the National Land Cover Database at each buffer zone. Using the mean percent canopy cover and impervious surface for each buffer zone at each camera location will allow for an analysis of how each of those variables affects the occurrence of coyotes and gray foxes.",poster,NA,2023,130
131,Wild Turkey Response to Mega-Wildfire in South Texas,"The wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is a key gamebird species to the Texas wildlife community that has an important ecological role in insect and native seed consumption and as part of the native food chain. In March 2022, a mega-wildfire impacted Kleberg County and burned over 200 square kilometers of rangeland. One of the major factors causing the fire to become so large was increased fuel loads from expanding vegetation growth during the higher rainfall periods in 2020 directly followed by drought conditions in 2021. Our objectives are to develop spatio-temporal approaches to assess changes in occupancy, detection, and abundance of wild turkeys after a large-scale fire and use thermal videography to assess wild turkey abundance using drones. To achieve these objectives, we are deploying 80 camera traps across four 10 km transects on the King Ranch that cover both unburned and burned sections of rangeland as well as the fire front itself. Each transect will be broken into twenty 500-m sampling units with one camera trap randomly placed within each. Once data is collected and sorted, we will use a multistate multi-season occupancy framework to examine our research objectives. Using the data from the camera traps and information from King Ranch personnel we will select locations of sites where turkeys may be roosting, and we will conduct night surveys using thermal sensors mounted on drones. These results will provide critical information on how mega-wildfires influence the occupancy, detection, and abundance of wild turkeys and aid in the development of future post-wildfire management techniques.",poster,NA,2023,131
132,Disease and Disturbance: Understanding the relationship between large-scale habitat,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, neurodegenerative prion disease that affects cervids. Genetic research suggests that amino acid substitutions at the prion protein gene (PRNP) site can result in reduced prevalence of CWD. In elk (Cervus canadensis), the M132 allele is associated with high CWD prevalence or susceptibility. Transmission of the prion occurs through direct contact with fluids (blood, saliva, or feces) of an infected animal with higher transmission expected in more social species. Prions can also exist in a bioavailable state for years in the environment, with clay soils in particular, associated with increased CWD prevalence. Industrial landscape disturbance such as mining and gas development alter geochemical soil properties, and may result in landscape characteristics that increase the prevalence of environmental CWD. We discuss the relationship between industrial landscape disturbance and CWD in North America, and use behavioral and genetic data from a freeranging population of elk in Kentucky as a case study. 298 elk were sampled from 2011 to 2014, direct observations were conducted, and PRNP was sequenced. 79.12% (235/298) of sampled individuals were homozygous M132 suggesting increased susceptibility to CWD, although behavioral data suggests little transmission potential. Reclaimed mines and other development sites serve as habitat for a variety of cervids in North America. Industrial development is booming particularly in Texas, and our understanding of the relationship between these disturbances, CWD ecology and management represents gaps in our knowledge. These disturbances are important factors to consider in managing CWD over the short and long-term.",poster,NA,2023,132
133,Using a ground-nesting bird to model variability in scale of effect in heterogeneous,"All organisms exist in heterogeneous landscapes, functioning across multiple scales that may be context specific. The scale of effect refers to the spatial scale at which a landscape has the strongest impact on an organism’s response, and organisms are expected to have disparate responses across spatio-temporal scales. Understanding the variability in scale of effect is of particular importance in human-altered landscapes, where anthropogenic impacts may affect organisms in unpredictable ways by altering functional heterogeneity. Humans have greatly altered shrubland and grassland ecosystems through land use change, fire suppression, and brush management practices. These impacts are of particular concern to ground-nesting birds, whose reproductive success is highly dependent on landscape configuration. The scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) inhabits arid and semiarid ecosystems that exhibit spatio-temporal variability in heterogeneity, partially driven by variability in annual climatic conditions. They have experienced recent range-wide declines, and drivers of this decline remain largely unexplained. In this study, we will use scaled quail nests as a model to analyze how variation in scale of effect is driven by annual variation in landscape context. We will aggregate scaled quail nest locations across four states and two decades to assess variation in scale of effect in relation to annual landscape dynamics and climatic variability determined from the Rangeland Analysis Platform. Results will illustrate intraspecific space-time dynamics of scale of effect within inherently heterogeneous landscapes.",poster,NA,2023,133
134,Sand Shinnery Oak Prairie Ecoregion Plant Community Composition Response to,"Wildfires and grazing by free-ranging herbivores historically directed plant community composition and created mosaics of habitats at scales that met the annual lifecycle needs of several species in the Southern Great Plains. Anthropogenic alteration of natural disturbances through continuous domestic livestock grazing regimes, fire suppression, row-crop agricultural, energy development, urban expansion, coupled with natural influences such as severe droughts, have severely altered plant communities in the Southern Great Plains. These alterations have greatly reduced available critical habitats required to meet the annual lifecycle needs of lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus; LEPC) populations, which have resulted in drastic LEPC population declines. Prescribed fire has been used with success in a variety of landscapes to direct plant community structure and species composition. However, quantification of vegetation response to prescribed-fire regimes and post-fire rest cycles in the Sand Shinnery Oak (Quercus havardii) Prairie Ecoregion (SSOP) is limited. Dominant vegetation composition in the SSOP consists of sand shinnery oak, sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifola), and tall, mixed, and shortgrass assemblages. Understanding vegetation community response to prescribed fire and post-fire rest regimes can assist in more efficiently and effectively managing areas of SSOP. Our study area was located on an Area of Critical Environmental Concern in Chaves County, New Mexico, managed for LEPC by the Bureau of Land Management. We surveyed plant community response to 5 spring prescribed-fire treatments, performed 2016 – 2021 by the BLM, using point-step transects (n = 385), identifying vegetation to species at points ~2 m apart along ~500-m transects.",poster,NA,2023,134
135,Influence of Pesticides on Avian Malaria Prevalence,"In recent years, anthropogenic impacts, such as extensive agriculture practices, have contributed to an accelerated decline in wildlife populations (Maxwell et al. 2016). Transmitted via Haemosporidian parasites, avian malaria requires an arthropod vector and can cause varying degrees of complications ranging from lower reproductive success (Knowles, Palinauskas, and Sheldon 2009) to extinction of naive species (Warner 1968). Avian malaria is a persistent threat with the global average infection probability of wild birds over 10% for three of the four haemosporidian parasite genera (Fecchio et al. 2021). We hypothesized that birds exposed to pesticides (cotton production areas) will have a higher prevalence of malaria infections than will birds from non-exposed areas. We present data on the relationship between foraging guilds and the prevalence of avian malaria in areas of high pesticide usage (two sites) versus areas of zero pesticide usage (three sites) in samples taken from Texas birds. We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with three primer sets, targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene, to determine whether samples were positive for malaria. Samples (n= 151) came from four orders of birds: Columbiformes, Galliformes, Piciformes, and Passeriformes. Samples were separated into two categories: dietary niche and cotton exposure levels (exposed or unexposed). Within the diet category, birds were classified as either insectivorous or granivorous.",poster,NA,2023,135
136,Cattle and Quail: An Adaptive Management Strategy for Livestock Grazing as a Quail,"Land management decisions, including the decision to do nothing, shape wildlife habitats. Chronic overgrazing of rangelands is detrimental to rangeland health and wildlife species, including quail that compete with grazers for screening and nesting cover. However, resting rangelands that evolved with grazers for extended periods of time can also be detrimental by decreasing species richness, increasing bare ground, and proliferating undesirable vegetation. Moderate grazing with domestic livestock improves ecological function of rangelands and is often used as a tool prescribed to mimic natural disturbance patterns. We will use an adaptive management framework to evaluate the long-term habitat effects of integrating a lightly stocked, rotational grazing program with quail management practices. The Rolling Plains Quail Research Ranch includes approximately 1900 ha of rangeland managed exclusively for quail that has not been grazed by livestock in the previous 10 years. Prior to the reintroduction of cattle, we will establish 45 25-m2 permanent grazing exclosures and 45 paired, grazed locations within 50 m of each exclosure. We will monitor changes in forage production (lbs/ha), bare ground, and species richness and compare to our control pastures. These data will be compared to guide decisions on the stocking rate and frequency of grazing each pasture. We will record weather data, other influential management actions, and revenues and costs of grazing. We anticipate that the results will demonstrate a trend toward an improved habitat and an example for quail managers to implement grazing on their properties.",poster,NA,2023,136
137,Prevalence of the Raccoon Roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis) in Panhandle and,"The raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis) is a parasitic nematode, found ubiquitously in the small intestine of common raccoons (Procyon lotor). With rapid urbanization statewide and the subsequent increased human and wildlife interactions, the raccoon roundworm is a growing One Health concern. B. procyonis is a rare, but considered very serious, cause of neurologic and ocular disease in humans. Human infection is more likely to occur when human and wildlife landscape use is overlapped. A previous study conducted in Southern and Central Texas found 5.4% prevalence among raccoons. The objective of this project is to quantify the prevalence of B. procyonis in Texas raccoons with special attention to the West and Panhandle regions for which there is virtually no surveillance or epidemiological data. For this project we will collect and evaluate fecal and gastrointestinal (GI) tract samples from raccoons for presence of B. procyonis. Raccoon carcasses will be collected from municipal animal control offices, picking up recently killed (24hr) hit-by-vehicle animals, and hunter-eliminated animals. Fecal samples will be collected from necropsied raccoons and from collaborators with access to fresh raccoon feces. All fecal samples will be examined for presence of B. procyoniseggs and GI tract samples will be examined for presence of adult worms. Fecal samples less than 2g will be processed using the fecal sedimentation method. Samples weighing 2g or more will be processed using both Sheather’s Sugar and zinc sulfate flotation methods.",poster,NA,2023,137
138,A novel method on acoustic signal determination for bird conservation using publicly,"Agriculture and grazing practices have been shown to reduce wildlife diversity by >18% and abundance by >50%. However, the variability of biodiversity impacts is high and likely linked to the specific grazing practices utilized. We measured bird diversity across four ranches in northeastern Texas that each had a different ranch management tenure and stocking rates. To do this we paired line transect surveys with a novel acoustical monitoring approach to test the efficacy of the Merlin Bird ID app’s ability to correctly identify bird richness at a site. Previous acoustic monitoring methods have sought to use machine learning algorithms to identify key focal species. However, this approach can ignore the vast majority of species data available when deploying acoustic monitors. We used the AI in the Merlin Bird ID app with acoustic data that we collected in the field. We then tested the accuracy of bird richness and rarity metrics collected and compared it with line transect surveys that co-occurred at each survey location. Using this acoustic monitoring protocol, we detected 9 species of bird acoustically, and 9 species of birds during the line transect. The acoustic data identified the presence of 3 additional species not observed during transect surveys. In addition, we found that the app had an accuracy of identification of total bird richness and rarity >75% with a false positive rate correctable to <1%. This approach should be useful to future researchers wishing to operationalize acoustic monitors without needing sophisticated, high-end supercomputing resources or training algorithms.",poster,NA,2023,138
139,The cost of a bun in the oven: using new technology to uncover the role of pregnancy,"Reproduction is typically the most demanding period of a mammal’s life cycle, with late gestation and lactation dramatically increasing energetic demand and fasting metabolic rate. This increase in metabolism creates higher heat loads that may negatively affect the condition and health of the female and her offspring. Additionally, reproduction also affects a mammal’s ability to thermoregulate and mitigate external heat stress. Determining the physiological cost of high environmental temperatures during reproductive periods is key to understanding the possible limits of thermoregulation. Vaginal implant transmitters (VITs) are commonly used for locating white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) birth sites and fawns. We retrofitted VITs with biologging technology including a temperature sensor and data logger to collect high resolution internal temperature data. We collected local environmental temperature data using black-body globes, which account for the influence of solar radiation on ambient temperature. We tested the hypothesis that pregnancy, time of day, and environmental temperatures would influence the internal temperature of white-tailed deer. We analyzed the internal temperature of seven unbred and three bred female deer from March to September 2022. We observed environmental temperatures ranging from -1 to 50°C, and internal temperatures of 33.5-42.5°C. We observed interactive effects of time of day, environmental temperature, and reproductive status on internal temperature. Greatest internal body temperatures occurred in bred females, during the day, at high environmental temperatures. Our approach of integrating novel technology to monitor both environmental temperature and internal body temperature revealed the effects of pregnancy on thermoregulation.

140,Northern Bobwhite Covey Locations on Fed and Unfed Ranches in South Texas,"Supplemental feeding is a common management strategy practiced by landowners and hunters for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). In South Texas, most ranches begin feeding in early December at the onset of hunting season. The practice is believed to improve hunting efficiency by decreasing the distance coveys are found from access roads and concentrating bobwhites in areas of lower brush density. In 2021, the East Foundation began a research project to investigate the effects of supplemental feed on bobwhite populations. We designated a 2,111-ha fed site in Jim Hogg County along with 2 unfed sites, a 6,118-ha site in Jim Hogg County and a 2,853-ha site in Kenedy County. We distributed grain sorghum weekly along access roads (i.e., quail lanes) on the fed site by spot-feeding at a rate of 19.4 kg/km. We documented covey locations during the 2021–2022 quail hunting season on all 3 sites using the CoveyIQ mobile application. The mean distance of hunter-covey encounters from access roads was 21.0 ± 1.4-meters on the fed site and 56.9 ± 2.2-meters on the unfed sites. The mean brush canopy coverage of covey encounters (~50 m radius) was 16.7 ± 0.3% on the fed site and 14.1 ± 0.3% on unfed sites. According to our findings, supplemental feeding decreases the distance of covey-encounter locations from access roads but does not concentrate coveys in areas of lower brush densities. We recommend that landowners and hunters consider the use of supplemental feeding when the management objective is to improve hunting efficiency.",poster,NA,2023,140
141,Environmental Conditions and the Efficiency of Northern Bobwhite Hunts in South,"Environmental conditions have a direct impact on the behavioral patterns of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). In South Texas, environmental conditions vary considerably throughout the seasons. Three of the environmental factors believed to affect bobwhite hunts are temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity. Managers often schedule hunting trips according to the perceived optimal ranges of these factors, attempting to increase hunting efficiency (i.e., coveys/hour). During the 2021–2022 Texas quail hunting season, we recorded the key environmental factors along with the hunting efficiency of 176 quail hunts. The hunts took place on East Foundation properties located in Jim Hogg and Kenedy Counties, Texas. Hunts began on 6 November 2021 and concluded on 26 February 2022. We found the mean hunting efficiency during 514.9 hours of hunting to be 3.1 ± 0.11 SE coveys per hour (range = 0.7–13.7). The mean daily temperature of hunts ranged between 4.4º and 26.6º C, relative humidity ranged between 26% and 95%, and windspeed ranged between 7 and 36 mph. We found no significant correlations (P ≤ 0.05) with the environmental conditions we measured, despite dramatic differences in mean daily temperatures, relative humidity, and wind speeds. We assume the lack of significance is due to hourly variations in environmental factors and logistical limitations regarding the total amount of coveys that can be found and hunted per hour. According to our findings, hunters can expect hunting efficiency and harvest to remain constant within the daily ranges of environmental conditions typical for South Texas.",poster,NA,2023,141
142,Correlating Density Surface Models with Trapping Success of Northern Bobwhites,"A growing trend in wildlife research is the use of spatially explicit models to estimate the densities of wildlife species, such as density surface modeling and occupancy modeling. One potential use for these models is to focus trapping efforts on areas that are predicted to have higher densities of target species to increase trapping efficiency (i.e., captures per trap hour). Trapping efficiency is often a critical factor of research efforts due to resource limitations (e.g., manpower, vehicles, equipment). To determine whether densities from spatially explicit models can be used to increase trapping efficiency, we have correlated the outcomes of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) trapping efforts with density estimates from density surface models. The research took place on the East Foundation’s San Antonio Viejo Ranch located in Jim Hogg County, Texas. The distance sampling survey used to construct the density surface model was conducted on 5 November 2019, and trapping occurred between 13 December 2019 and 9 January 2020. Northern bobwhites were trapped using standard funnel traps baited with grain sorghum. Trained researchers would check traps every 3 hours, documenting when northern bobwhites were captured and whether traps were disturbed by non-target species. We did not find a significant correlation (P≤0.05) between trapping success and bobwhite densities, but these results may be influenced by our sample size. We will include the 2020–2021, 2021– 2022, and 2022–2023 data sets in our final analysis and make determinations regarding the use of spatially explicit models with targeted trapping efforts.",poster,NA,2023,142
143,Monitoring the Prevalence of Eyeworms in South Texas Bobwhites,"The increase of eyeworms (Oxyspirura petrowi) in northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) is speculated to be a factor in the decline of bobwhite populations in the Rolling Plains Ecoregion of Texas over the last century. Where eyeworm prevalence in the Rolling plains is estimated to be over 40%, researchers in the South Texas Plains have observed eyeworms in less than 10% of the samples collected. Monitoring eyeworm prevalence so it does not become an increasing concern is important to the conservation of bobwhites in South Texas. In this study, we investigated eyeworm prevalence in bobwhites in South Texas via necropsy of hunter-harvested quail from East Foundation ranches in Jim Hogg and Kenedy Counties, Texas. Bobwhite heads were collected during a large-scale harvest study from 2019–2022. Complete necropsies (eyelids, nictitating membrane, lacrimal ducts, lacrimal glands, and Harderian glands) were conducted on 406 bobwhite heads in South Texas to identify eyeworm prevalence in the area. There is a suspected correlation between the age and the prevalence of eyeworms, therefore, samples consisted of both adult (n =89) and juvenile (n = 317) bobwhites. We did not find any evidence of eyeworms in the sample of bobwhites. Continuous monitoring of eyeworms and other potentially pathogenic diseases in bobwhites across Texas helps keep the hunting and research community up to date on the changing conditions of an economically important game species. For this reason, we will continue to necropsy bobwhite heads on East Foundation ranches throughout each harvest season.",poster,NA,2023,143
144,Prescribed Fire Effects on Northern Bobwhite Nest Site Selection and Survival,"Research in mesic environments has shown northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) require biennial prescribed fire to create and maintain habitat in optimal seral communities for survival and reproduction. However, there is a lack of data on the relationship between fire, nest site selection, and nest survival in arid environments, such as the Southern Great Plains, where frequent drought may often delay vegetative response following fire. Lack of quick regrowth could reduce usable space and-or reduce survivability of nests lacking concealment in areas burned but not sufficiently recovered. Our goal is to evaluate nest site selection and nest survival as they relate to prescribed fire to refine management recommendations on the scale and timing of burns in arid regions managed for bobwhite. We will integrate a long term (2010-2022) nest survival (n = 472 nests) and location dataset with past prescribed fire application (1,476 ha) on the Rolling Plains Quail Research Ranch in Fisher County, TX, USA. We will estimate nest site selection and nest survival as a function of proportion of burn surrounding nest, time since burn, and drought intensity. We expect nest survival to be lower for nests surrounded by large areas burned in the current year due to lack of concealment and heightened predation risks. However, we suspect the probability of use of these areas will be lower than areas without fire, especially during below-average rainfall conditions. This research will result in refined prescribed fire prescriptions to enhance reproductive conditions for bobwhite in arid regions.",poster,NA,2023,144
145,Herbicide Resources For Wildlife Biologists,"Abstract: When is it appropriate to use an herbicide in wildlife habitat management? Are the problematic plants resprouting brush or perennial weed species? What herbicides are available? What is the difference between suppression and control? These are some of the questions facing wildlife biologists working on wildlife management areas, national wildlife refuges, and private lands. Luckily there are many sources of information available to answer these questions and many others regarding using herbicides. Novice and veteran wildlife biologists need to become more familiar with using herbicides as a tool for managing wildlife habitats and giving science-based advice to private landowners. Our poster will define common terms associated with herbicide use and identify sources of information when using herbicides for wildlife habitat management.",poster,NA,2023,145
146,Improving detectability of the Tamaulipan Spot-tailed Earless Lizard at Laughlin AFB,"A robust population of the Tamaulipan Spot-tailed Earless Lizard (Holbrookia subcaudalis) persists on the airfield at Laughlin Air Force Base, where up to 375 pilots receive flight training annually. The airfield habitat management designed to support this flight training mission is also beneficial to this species, which is being considered for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Intensive radio-telemetry research in 2017 yielded high numbers of H. subcaudalis at LAFB. Since then, monthly monitoring surveys in the same area yielded far fewer individuals than expected, although we have no reason to suspect a reduction in population. This suggests these monitoring surveys are better at detecting presence than estimating abundance for H. subcaudalis. To improve surveys for abundance estimation, we tested different survey approaches for detecting H. subcaudalis at LAFB by simultaneously employing walking and driving surveys in areas where lizards were fit with radio-telemetry tags. We examined variation in detection success across survey months and times, survey type, and weather conditions. We detected 151 H. subcaudalis on the airfield during April-August 2022, and captured and marked 73 individuals (24 females, 48 males; 51 adults, 22 juveniles). We detected five times as many H. subcaudalis during driving surveys compared to walking surveys, and we detected more H. subcaudalis during sunny afternoons (1600-1800 h) in April-May, with temperatures >30°C. Our research results refine survey approaches for H. subcaudalis at LAFB and potentially other populations of the species range-wide.",poster,NA,2023,146
147,"Effects of Range Management on the Plateau Spot-tailed Earless Lizard, Year 1 Results","The plateau spot-tailed earless lizard (Holbrookia lacerata) is endemic to Central Texas semi-desert grasslands of the Edwards Plateau. The species is undergoing a status review for federal listing in the U.S. due to perceived population declines across much of its range. Previous research on H. lacerata microhabitat showed they are most often found on bare ground and less likely to be found in brushy areas. Range management practices such as grazing and prescribed fire can produce landscape mosaics with more frequent patches of bare ground which in turn may be better habitat for H. lacerata. We are using the long-term control, grazing and fire management treatments at Sonora’s Texas A&M AgriLife Research Station in northwestern Edwards County to discern which management practices benefit H. lacerata. These treatments reflect range management practices already being implemented in the region, meaning that results from this study can be transferred directly into conservation actions to benefit the species. We have completed the first of 3 survey years for H. lacerata using a stratified random sampling design with 34 0.8-ha circular survey plots across the control, experimental grazing and fire treatments on the property. We found 7 H. lacerata during surveys in the plots and 6 H. lacerata opportunistically. Holbrookia lacerata were found primarily in burned (n=4), grazed (n=3) and burned and grazed areas (n=5), but only one was found (opportunistically) in the control areas. While preliminary results are consistent with expectations for this species, we look forward to continuing surveys in 2023-24.",poster,NA,2023,147
148,Texas Statewide Summary of Red Crossbill Location Records by Ecoregion From 2017,"The Red Crossbill RECR (Loxia curvirostra) is a Holarctic seed-eating finch with considerable vocal and morphological variation. The complex biology and wanderings of the species made attempts to delineate subspecies difficult. Instead, researchers began to identify RECR based on the structure of their flight calls. In North America, eleven distinctive forms have been identified based primarily on “call type” and bill morphology. Bill size and palate structure differ among some forms, and correspond to the species of conifer seed most efficiently foraged upon. Different call types may represent cryptic species with vocal differences great enough to provide the basis for reproductive isolation. RECR breeding and movements are erratic, and appear to be dependent on conifer seed crops. During times of poor seed production within their core range, crossbills may wander widely in search of food. Here we present a Texas statewide summary of a major RECR invasion that began in Fall 2017. Most RECR reports (97.6 %) were obtained from online eBird checklists. A statewide total of 374 reports from 115 locations are included. The species persisted in Texas into March 2021, but the majority (88%) of reported locations were from October 2017 through May 2018. Seven of the ten Gould ecoregions of Texas reported RECR. The Trans Pecos ecoregion had the most locations (39.1%) followed by the High Plains (19.1%). RECR call type was confirmed for only 28 (7.5%) of the 374 reports with the most common being Type 2 (ponderosa pine) followed by Type 4 (Douglasfir).",poster,NA,2023,148
149,Free-ranging Domestic Cat Management on Conservation Lands: A Partnership,"Domestic cats (Felis catus) are among the most harmful invasive species globally and are the top source of direct, anthropogenic bird mortality in North America. In addition to their predatory impact, domestic cats are also a source for the transmission of a variety of parasites and diseases to wildlife and people. Domestic cat management, however, is complicated by the species’ close association with people as pets, as well as the compassionate, but often misguided, behavior of individuals tending to unowned domestic cats. This poster focuses on the need for and best practices regarding domestic cat management, including a response framework, technical guidance, and relevant policies, as well as an opportunity for partnership with American Bird Conservancy to implement free-ranging domestic cat management.",poster,NA,2023,149
150,Unexpected Allies: Woodrats and Rabbits Provide Escape Cover for Quail,"Habitat management is considered of key importance for conservation of quail species, but some aspects, such as predator-specific escape cover use is poorly understood. We assessed types of escape cover used by scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) and Gambel’s quail (C. gambelii) pursued by trained birds of prey. We collected escape cover data for 68 quail pursued by falconry birds in winter 2021-2022. Quail pursued were Gambel’s quail (Callipepla gambelii) and scaled quail (C. squamata). All pursuits were by either a northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) or a Eurasian sparrowhawk (A. nisus) in the vicinities of Albuquerque or Deming NM. Landcovers of the pursuits were described as Chihuahuan Grassland (26.5%), Cholla-Grassland (19.1%), Sage-Grassland (25.0%), or High Desert (29.4%). The dominant escape cover chosen by quail were woodrat (Neotoma spp.) middens (62.5%) associated with prickly pear (Opuntia spp.; 27.1%), woody shrubs (22.9%), or cholla (Cylindropuntia spp.; 12.5%). Fewer rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.) burrows (4.2%) were used but may have been underestimated due to concealment in cover. Prickly pear patches accounted for 14.6% of the standing vegetation used as escape cover, followed by woody shrubs or yucca (6.3%). Preliminarily, our evidence suggests 66.7% of quail escape cover was provided by woodrats and rabbits. Thus, these two species may be important to consider in a community context when managing for quail habitat. We are collecting a second year of data with more falconry birds and sample areas and are including northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) in the field trials.",poster,NA,2023,150
151,Effectiveness of Using eDNA to Detect Alligator Snapping Turtles,"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is being proposed for federal listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Current information on the status, distribution, and abundance of alligator snapping turtles is lacking, which makes development of a comprehensive conservation plan difficult. Development of these management actions is dependent on reliable methodologies that can quantify the presence of alligator snapping turtles. Traditional survey methods (hoop traps) have been proven to successfully capture alligator snapping turtles; however, they can pose a threat to target and non-target species. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of using environmental DNA (eDNA) to determine the presence of alligator snapping turtles. To test this, we surveyed 38 sites by collecting 3L of water per site to test for eDNA. Each site was concurrently surveyed using traditional hoop traps. At 21 sites (55%), we had congruence in detection outcomes of alligator snapping turtles with both eDNA and trapping efforts. At 4 sites (11%) alligator snapping turtles were potentially detected with eDNA and successfully captured in traps, at 11 sites (29%) alligator snapping turtles were captured in traps and eDNA failed to detect presence and at 2 sites (1 potential eDNA and 1 positive eDNA; 5% combined) alligator snapping turtles were detected with eDNA but no turtles were captured in traps. We successfully used eDNA techniques to detect alligator snapping turtles, however understanding the variability in detection outcomes in the context of habitat covariates would further refine this technique to be used more broadly by natural resource managers.",poster,NA,2023,151
152,"Reintroduction of the Louisiana Pinesnake (Pituophis ruthveni) in Grant Parish,","Ongoing surveys suggest that populations of the Louisiana Pinesnake (Pituophis ruthveni) are restricted to a few small blocks of degraded and highly fragmented habitat. The species requires frequently burned sites with a well-developed herbaceous understory capable of supporting populations of its primary prey, Baird’s Pocket Gopher (Geomys breviceps). Recent changes in management practices on U. S. Forest Service lands have resulted in restoration of substantial blocks of suitable habitat, which are now available for reintroduction. A captive population has been established from wild-caught snakes from Bienville Parish, LA. The reintroduction site is located on the Catahoula District of the Kisatchie National Forest. Two hundred ninety-one individuals have been released to date. Currently, automated pit tag readers and trapping are the primary monitoring techniques. To date, 51 snakes have been detected the year following release, or later. Four of those snakes have been detected 7 or more years following release. Monitoring results suggest that growth and health of released snakes are adequate, and survival is encouraging. Production of neonates in the zoos and release of young will be repeated annually until a viable population is established, or it is concluded that further releases are not likely to result in establishment of a population.",poster,NA,2023,152
153,Finding a GEM: An Integrated and Tiered Approach to Grassland Habitat Treatment,"In recent years, there have been many successful voluntary conservation programs, such as the USFWS Partners Program and the Grassland Restoration Incentive Program (GRIP), that work with private landowners to restore critically declining grassland habitat in Texas (98% privately owned). Though the success of these restoration and conservation programs are a step in the right direction to slow grassland habitat degradation and loss, few monitoring protocols exist that scientifically evaluate the extent to which habitat is successfully restored and if best management practices were used. Therefore, members of the USFWS, USGS, Oaks and Prairies Joint Venture, Texas Parks and Wildlife, and Rio Grande Joint Venture developed the Grassland Effectiveness Monitoring (GEM) protocols which are modified from the Bureau of Land Management Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) strategy, and are compatible with data collected by the Natural Resources Conservation Service National Resource Inventory rangeland on-site survey. Thus, GEM is a statistically robust, user-friendly option to assess the effectiveness of best management practices used in restoring grassland habitat. After two years of pilot field work, GEM is proving to be scientifically sound in its ability to detect changes in vegetation structure post-management. GEM allows users to choose between three different tiered approaches, with each protocol having varying levels of complexity, catering to expertise level, monitoring goals, budget, and project timelines. Therefore, by creating a standardized protocol that can be widely used in grassland restoration across North America, we may be better prepared to understand how management practices are influencing restoration efforts.",poster,NA,2023,153
154,Movement and Habitat Selection of Repatriated Alligator Snapping Turtles in Eastern,"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is the largest freshwater turtle in North America. Although M. temminckii occur in a variety of riverine habitats, they possess a life history characterized by high juvenile mortality and longer maturation periods. Therefore, mortalities associated with illegal harvest or bycatch may exacerbate local population declines. Knowledge of their spatial ecology in the wild is limited, and only a few translocation studies are known. Here, we investigated the movement and habitat use (i.e., macro- and microhabitat selection) of repatriated M. temminckii to explore the feasibility of repatriation efforts. Twentythree M. temminckii, confiscated by federal agents, were released at three sites in east Texas. Turtles were fitted with VHF radios and tracked weekly from June 2021 to July 2022. Microhabitat variables were collected at turtle localities and paired random points. Macrohabitat use was determined in ArcGIS with data from the National Land Cover Database. We performed hierarchal modeling to assess habitat selection with site and seasonal effects as predictors. We found that movement distances decreased in winter months, though seasonal movement varied across sites. Turtles selected similar microhabitats across sites. However, we found macrohabitat selection was influenced by both seasonal and site effects. This suggest that site characteristics (i.e., hydrological regimes, habitat patch size) on the landscape may affect how individuals respond post-repatriation. More in-depth studies are needed to determine if these efforts may help bolster wild populations. If so, repatriation could be a useful tool for future conservation efforts of M. temminckii.",poster,NA,2023,154
155,Behavioral Response of Wild Pigs to Aerial Gunning,"Wild pigs are a destructive invasive species, and their population continues to increase. The U.S. government spends $30.5 million annually to control the wild pig problem. The increase in research on wild pigs has improved the effectiveness of control efforts, but additional work is needed to assess cost:benefit ratio of management techniques. Our objectives were to analyze short-term movement responses and resource selection of wild pigs to aerial gunning pressure. In January and February 2020, we trapped 29 adult wild pigs in an agricultural matrix in Delta County, Texas and fitted each with a GPS collar that collected a location at 1-hr intervals. Texas Wildlife Services carried out aerial gunning of wild pigs from a helicopter platform as part of ongoing management efforts throughout our study area during February 1727 and March 25-26, 2020. We analyzed GPS locations in 3 stages: two weeks pre-gunning, during gunning, and two weeks post-gunning. We calculated 95% utilization distribution based on biased random bridges, step lengths, and step selection functions to assess resource selection. We used a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, grouping the wild pigs by helicopter contact status and stage. Wild pigs that had closer contact with the helicopter had higher movement rates and displayed stronger selection for woody cover, but none left the area in response to gunning. Our results will help managers with future decisions on removal efforts and to consider aerial gunning as a practical tool for damage reduction from local pigs.",poster,NA,2023,155
156,Scaled Quail Food Preference in West Texas,"The proper management of quail or any wildlife species requires the knowledge of habitat preferences and diet selection. Prior literature investigating diet selection of scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) has been performed in Arizona and New Mexico, however, but few have been reported in Texas. Identifying specific food preference can allow proper management of this species in West Texas where scaled quail once flourished but have declined due to poor land use practices. The objective of this project will be to determine food preference by identifying food contents found within the crops of hunter harvested scaled quail in 2014 and 2015 from Presidio County, TX. Each crop will be individually assessed by separating the contents by seed, mast, vegetative, and insect. All contents will be weighed by species to provide an approximate unit of mass. The goal is to develop preference indices based on data collected from each individual crop and prior vegetation sampling that was conducted in 2015 where quail were harvested. The results can assist landowners and agencies with the knowledge of plants that provide valuable habitat and potential nutritional value to improve the sustainability for future scaled quail populations.",poster,NA,2023,156
1,Navigating the fragmented thornscrub: using fine-scale movement data to assess disparate responses to fragmentation in a declining galliform,"Anthropogenic impacts force organisms to function in novel ways, and species must
either alter their behavior or disperse away from these pressures to persist. In South Texas,
Tamaulipan thornscrub has been subject to widespread degradation and fragmentation as a
result of brush management practices such as brush removal. The chestnut-bellied scaled quail
(Callipepla squamata castanogastris; hereafter “scaled quail”) is a declining, ground-nesting bird
that is uniquely dependent upon the Tamaulipan thornscrub. By studying the fine-scale
movement patterns of scaled quail, we may better understand how brush management
practices are affecting the functionality of Tamaulipan thornscrub. From February 2022 to
August 2023, we fit 129 scaled quail with GPS transmitters that recorded locations every four
hours at ranches in Duval and Dimmit County, Texas, USA, representing areas of declining and
stable populations, respectively. Landscape variables (i.e., road density, oil/gas development,
and vegetation structure/landcover) were included in integrated step selection functions to
examine how multiple mechanisms of brush removal influenced spatial responses of scaled
quail across spatiotemporal scales (four-hour and twelve-hour temporal grains). Across both
study sites and temporal grains, selection for thornscrub and avoidance of sandy mesquite
shrublands and grasslands was evident, though disparate responses (avoidance or selection) to
landscape variables (i.e., total core area of habitat) and anthropogenic features existed across
different spatiotemporal scales. Our results highlight the complexity of spatial responses to
thornscrub fragmentation, which are context-specific. Accounting for disparity in responses can
better inform larger connectivity models focused on managing metapopulation dynamics.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2024,NA
2,Science and Policy Behind Plans for Reintroducing Ocelots to Historic Range in Texas,"In 2021, a new collaboration was established to re-energize recovery efforts for
endangered ocelots (Leopardus pardalis pardalis) in Southern Texas. The focus was to develop
plans to reintroduce an additional ocelot population to a part of the cat’s historic, but now
unoccupied, range in Texas. To support reintroduction planning, our objectives were to identify
a reintroduction site, model ocelot reintroduction at the site, write plans for breeding and
reintroducing ocelots, and create a policy proposal for ocelot reintroduction that would address
private landowners’ concerns about expanding the range of a federally protected species. First,
we developed a geospatial habitat suitability assessment that identified a suitable reintroduction
site in South Texas based on a suite of ecological and socio-political factors. We then used
population viability analyses to build a demographic model of ocelot reintroduction at the
selected site and compare possible release strategies. We found that ocelot releases must be
implemented long-term to establish a viable population. We used information from these
scientific analyses to develop protocols for implementing the reintroduction program. Finally, we
integrated all information into a proposed Programmatic Safe Harbor Agreement that will
support ocelot recovery while also protecting the interests of private landowners whose lands
are necessary for ocelot reintroduction. Our study provides the scientific and policy framework
for plans for ocelot reintroduction. It has also shown how universities, agencies, conservation
organizations, and landowners can work together to design innovative plans for conserving
endangered species on private lands.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2024,NA
3,Comparing behaviors and demographic outcomes for extant and translocated eastern wild turkeys in east Texas and west-central Louisiana,"Abundance of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) in east Texas has
been unstable at best, leading to ongoing restoration efforts. Our objective was to evaluate
behavioral decisions and subsequent demographic outcomes by comparing translocated and
extant eastern wild turkeys across east Texas and west-central Louisiana. GPS data was
collected from 222 extant adult females (nTX  = 25, nLA = 197) and 45 translocated adult
females only in east Texas. Translocated females had lower nest success (x ̄ extant = 0.14;
x ̄ translocated = 0.08), produced less nests per potential hen (x ̄ extant = 1.37; x ̄translocated =
1.13), and had worse annual survival than extant females (x ̄ extant = 0.75; x ̄ translocated = 0.65).
Extant females in Louisiana and Texas had similar nest success (x ̄ TX = 0.14; x ̄ LA = 0.14) but
varied in nests/potential female (x ̄ TX = 1.72; x ̄ LA = 1.32) and annual survival (x ̄ TX = 0.66; x ̄ LA =
0.76). Prospecting for mates and resources should be done in the first nest pre-laying period,
where we saw the biggest behavioral differences between translocated and extant females.
Range size was double (x ̄ extant = 521 ha; x ̄ translocated = 1090 ha) and the probability of
sharing space was much less likely (Probextant = 0.70; Probtranslocated = 0.54) for
translocated adult females. These pre-laying behavioral differences are due to a lack of
landscape familiarity for translocated females, which lead to direct demographic consequences
tied to finding mates, identifying resources, and avoiding predators. These behavioral
differences are likely the driving force behind the depressed demographic outcomes for
translocated eastern wild turkeys.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2024,NA
4,Influence of Traffic Volume on the Carnivore Community Composition within the Road Effect Zone,"Disturbance from vehicle noise and human activity extends into nearby habitat,
creating a road effect zone characterized by changes in the wildlife community structure and
species’ behavior. This can impact conservation efforts along roads, such as wildlife crossing
construction. To ensure that conservation efforts are effective, we must understand how
mammals use road areas. We set camera traps along a low-traffic highway on the East
Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch in Willacy County and a high-traffic highway on the Hacienda
Yturria Ranch in Kenedy County from May 2022 to April 2023. We set camera traps using a
randomized block design with transects set perpendicular to the highway. Seven camera traps
were set in each of seven transects, at 200 m intervals, starting 50 m from the highway. We
assessed how traffic volume and distance from highway affected the mammal community
composition. We detected nearly all known mammal species larger than rodents (n=24),
including all known carnivores (n=10). The mammal community showed differences in
community structure near the low-volume highway, near the high-volume highway, and far from
both highways. Community composition was more variable around the high-volume highway
than the low-volume highway. Our study provides information on how mammals use road effect
zones and how vehicle traffic impacts use. By comparing a low-traffic highway to a high-traffic
highway, we provide information to landowners and the Texas Department of Transportation
about how traffic volume could impact management practices on working lands around
highways and future conservation efforts for mammals living around roads.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2024,NA
5,Pronghorn Susceptibility to Prion Diseases Through PRNP Sequencing,"Prion diseases such as Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) are a concern to wildlife
managers, public health officials, and the public.  Given the complexity of prion transmission,
and history of spontaneous generation of novel prion diseases, the possibility of interfamilial
transmission has become a concern. Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) utilize similar habitat
as susceptible Cervids and occur within the endemic CWD area of Colorado and Wyoming.
However, no published literature specifically on pronghorn susceptibility to prion diseases
including CWD exists, as they have been assumed to be resistant.  In Texas, pronghorn occur
in portions of both the Texas Panhandle and the Trans-Pecos regions, which both contain
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department CWD surveillance zones.  Our goal was to sequence the
prion protein gene, PRNP, exon 3 in pronghorn from Texas and New Mexico to compare to
amino acid sequences of known susceptible Cervids and assess if pronghorn could be
susceptible to prion diseases. We amplified and sequenced PRNP from 47 individuals from
Texas (including intra-state translocated individuals) and 28 individuals from New Mexico using
standard PCR techniques. Phylogenetic analyses were utilized to compare alignment of PRNP
in pronghorn to that of known, prion disease-susceptible ruminants. Our research identified that
pronghorn have one additional octapeptide repeat, for a total of 6, rather than the 5 peptide
repeats present in Cervids. Additionally, pronghorn share similarities to Cervid genotypes
characterized by codons 95, 96, 116, 132, 225 and 226, indicating that pronghorn possess all
the amino acids correlated with greater susceptibility to prion diseases in",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2024,NA
6,Nonbreeding ecology of female northern pintails and links to fitness,"The northern pintail (Anas acuta; hereafter pintail) remains below population
objectives and investigating nonbreeding ecology may untangle some uncertainties of
nonbreeding conditions influencing fitness. Our objectives were to investigate winter landscape
structure on pintail energy expenditure, and to assess the efficacy of winter wetland
management on spring migration performance. Female pintails were captured in different
wintering regions in the US and fitted with tracking devices. In objective one, we calculated daily
home ranges for each pintail during winter, calculated daily step-lengths (km), and daily Overall
Dynamic Body Acceleration (ODBA, a proxy for energy expenditure). Land-cover datasets were
reclassified into either water, development, grasslands/pasture, or cultivated grains. We
calculated several FRAGSTATS metrics. We conducted Generalized Linear Mixed Models
(GLMMs), with landscape metrics as predictors and daily ODBA and daily step-lengths the
responses. We found increasing water decreased step-lengths and increasing
grassland/pasture increased ODBA and step-lengths in pintails. In objective two, we calculated
the proportion of GPS locations on both managed and non-managed sites for each pintail. We
calculated four spring migration metrics: departure date from wintering area, number of
migratory stopovers, total migration duration, and arrival date to breeding areas. Using GLMMs,
we regressed spring migration metrics on proportional use of managed sites. Greater
proportional use on managed sites resulted in a significantly earlier departure from wintering
areas and earlier arrival on breeding areas. We show wetland management allows pintails to
arrive on breeding areas sooner and our findings are expected to help resource managers
optimally place sanctuaries within landscapes.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2024,NA
7,Evaluating Use of Rangeland Analysis Platform Data to Develop Site-Level Habitat Relationships of Northern Bobwhite,"Remotely sensed imagery has been increasing and becoming readily available for
managers to use in management. The Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) is a publicly
available resource that provides estimates of biomass production and percentages of cover for
various plant functional groups. The objective of our research was to evaluate the feasibility of
using RAP data to quantify habitat-relative abundance relationships for northern bobwhites
(Colinus virginianus).  We conducted quail roadside surveys on 13 sites (n = 1‒5 routes/site, n =
28 total routes) across South Texas during August‒September 2022 to estimate mean bobwhite
relative abundance (no. of bobwhite/km).  We buffered survey routes 400 m on both sides and
obtained habitat data (annual forb and grass cover, perennial forb and grass cover, bare
ground, litter cover, shrub cover, and tree cover) from RAP, and annual and seasonal
precipitation from PRISM. We used a generalized linear model to evaluate the influence of
habitat or precipitation on bobwhite relative abundance. We documented a negative response
with litter cover (pseudo r2 = 0.13) but a positive response with perennial forb and grass cover
(pseudo r2 = 0.19).  In addition, bobwhite relative abundance was positively related with annual
precipitation (pseudo r2 = 0.39).  These findings are in line with ecological expectations and
provide evidence that RAP may be a useful resource in bobwhite research and management.
Our results suggest that managers may be able to minimize bobwhite population lows during
low annual precipitation by managing for perennial forb and grass communities with low litter
cover.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1,2024,NA
8,"Assessment of Scaled Quail Habitat Selection and Movement Behavior on an Active Oil and Gas Field in the Permian Basin, Texas","Oil and gas development influences wildlife through various factors across space,
species, and ecoregions. Research highlighting how oil/gas development affects the already
declining scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) populations of Texas remains understudied,
especially in the Permian Basin region. We sought to evaluate how scaled quail habitat
selection and movement behavior are affected by oil and gas development and supplemental
quail feeders in the Permian Basin of West Texas, USA. Additionally, we were interested in
habitat selection and movement behavior variation across seasons. We used integrated step
selection analysis to identify which environmental and/or anthropogenic factors affected scaled
quail habitat selection and/or movement behavior across well pad densities (0.5 pads/km2 and
5 pads/km2). We determined that monthly vegetation greenness, distance to well pads, distance
to supplemental feeders, and various movement variables significantly affect scaled quail
habitat selection and movement behavior. We then utilized principal component analyses to
discern whether differences occurred across intensities and seasons. We found that scaled
quail do not select habitat or move differently across well pad densities or seasons. However,
their niche expands considerably during the winter months of the non-breeding, covey season.
This suggests that scaled quail reduced intraspecific competition as resources decreased
through expanding their niche breadth. Furthermore, we identified the existence of diel activity
patterns in habitat selection and movement. These results suggest that wildlife managers
working with oil companies should continue to focus on land restoration efforts and consider
implementing supplemental feeding to manage scaled quail populations.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1,2024,NA
9,Exploring Drought-Legacy Effects in Northern Bobwhite in Texas,"Abstract: A drought-legacy effect is a phenomenon whereby current-year responses
of an ecosystem are affected by prior-year(s) rainfall. Drought-legacy effects have been
documented in grassland ecosystems, but it is unknown whether such legacy effects also
influence wildlife dependent on these systems such as grassland-bird species. Northern
bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations in semiarid rangelands are strongly influenced by
rainfall. Thus, it is plausible that bobwhite populations in arid environments are subjected to
drought-legacy effects. Our objective was to quantify the relationship between bobwhite
abundance and current-year and prior-year Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (PMDI).
Our study focused on bobwhite populations of northern Texas (Rolling Plains and Cross
Timbers and Prairies) and southern Texas (Rio Grande Plains and Gulf Prairies and Marshes).
We used a long-term dataset (1978–2022) of bobwhite relative abundance collected by Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) using roadside surveys and a corresponding dataset of
PMDI to analyze the influence of current- and prior-year PMDI (i.e., drought-legacy effects) on
bobwhite abundance in each region. We documented a significant interaction between current-
year and prior-year PMDI in northern Texas (P ≤ 0.0001) and southern Texas (P = 0.0014) and
thus evidence for a legacy effect. The response of bobwhites to current-year PMDI increased
significantly (P ≤ 0.05) when prior-year PMDI changed from drought (PMDI = -4) to normal
(PMDI = 0) to wet (PMDI = 4). Our findings show that a drought-legacy effect exists and
influences bobwhite abundance in northern and southern Texas.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1,2024,NA
10,Influence of Rainfall on Northern Bobwhite Reproduction,"Quail populations in semiarid environments experience drastic fluctuations, which are
strongly influenced by rainfall. Despite decades of research, the mechanisms driving this
relationship are unknown. While past research has focused on the materialized effects of
rainfall, we propose that rainfall itself, or closely associated factors, influence population
dynamics by serving as reproductive cues. Rainfall may provide supplemental information that
stimulates quail reproduction in sermiarid environments. Our study evaluated rainfall itself a as
reproductive cue for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) in semiarid rangelands. During
April—August 2023, we housed northern bobwhite hens (n=30 hens) in outdoor aviary cages
that were subject to ambient environmental conditions. We collected blood before and after
rainfall events to monitor changes in reproductive hormones and recorded eggs daily. We
measured reproductive hormone (i.e., luteinizing hormone, LH) concentrations in blood samples
using ELISAs and calculated egg-laying rates. We also deployed autonomous recording units at
8 sites (1 unit/site) across South Texas to monitor changes in wild bobwhite calling behavior
before, during, and after rainfall events. We used the web application BirdSong to detect wild
bobwhite calls in our bioacoustic recordings and calculated calling rates. Here we report
changes in bobwhite reproductive behavior (LH, egg laying, and calling rate) as a function of
rainfall events and discuss the implication of these findings.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1,2024,NA
11,Demographics of Northern Bobwhite Translocated to the Pineywoods Ecoregion of Texas,"Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) have largely disappeared from the
Pineywoods of Texas. Restoration of populations has been successful in the southeastern
United States following translocation. We radiomarked and translocated 120 bobwhite from
Florida to a 3,622-ha area in Polk County, Texas. Sixty bobwhite were translocated in January
2023 and the remainder in March. We monitored bobwhite daily to estimate demographics of
the two cohorts. During 6 January to 17 October 2023, cumulative survival was 0.52 (95% CI =
0.39–0.65) and 0.28 (95% CI = 0.17–0.42) for January and March cohorts, respectively. We
entered breeding season (April 15) with 54 females (nJanF = 25, nMarF = 29) and 55 males
(nJanM = 27, nMarM = 28); the first nest was observed on 9 May and 6 May for January and
March cohorts, respectively. We found 74 nests; nest incubation rates were 1.06 nests/female
(NRJanF = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.61–1.38, NRMarF = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.84–1.64) and 0.31
nests/male (NRJanM = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.20–0.69, NRMarM = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.19–0.50).
Pooled across sexes, nest success was 49% (NSJan = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.31–0.64, NSMar =
0.52, 95% CI = 0.33–0.70). Productivity was 5.09 chicks/female (CRJanF = 5.19, 95% CI =
4.39–6.15, CRMarF = 5.00 chicks/female, 95% CI = 4.25–5.88) and 1.35 chicks/male (CRJanM
= 1.22, 95% CI = 0.87–1.72, CRMarM = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.08–1.99). Overall, demographics
were comparable to growing populations.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1,2024,NA
12,The Influence of Landcover and Weather on Northern Bobwhite Population Growth in Texas,"Northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) inhabit semi-arid rangelands and open
woodlands in the United States, and their populations have been experiencing distribution-wide
declines for the past century. Habitat loss and fragmentation have been hypothesized as
potential factors driving the population decline at large spatial scales; however, long-term
changes in weather (i.e. rain, temperature, and soil moisture) traditionally have not been
considered as contributing factors. The objective of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis
that habitat loss and long-term weather trends influence bobwhite population growth in northern
and southern Texas. We used 2019 National Land Cover Data as well as historical (1978–1992)
and projected (1992–2022) land cover data from the United States Geological Survey to assess
bobwhite habitat connectivity and configuration. We also used data from the National Centers
for Environmental Information to quantify weather within each region using Palmer Modified
Drought Index values. Here we report on the influence of habitat amount (%) and weather
(PMDI) on bobwhite population growth and discuss the relative importance of each. Our findings
will 1) provide a better understanding of the degree to which fragmentation and weather
influence bobwhites in Texas, and 2) help guide species conservation at regional scales.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 1,2024,NA
13,Reproductive status limits thermoregulatory behavior in white-tailed deer,"Altering space use and diel activity patterns are animal behaviors that balance
energetic needs and thermoregulation. However, reproduction increases energetic requirements
and limits thermoregulatory efficiency. We assessed how environmental temperature influenced
when and where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter “deer”) foraged and
accessed water depending on reproductive status. We monitored activity patterns associated
with foraging and drinking at shaded/unshaded feed stations of six pregnant and 11 non-
pregnant captive deer using camera traps May through August 2022 in Kingsville, Texas, USA.
We measured black body environmental temperature and identified periods of extreme heat
(daily mean > average high).  We recorded 5,785 foraging and 7,117 drinking events and
analyzed the coefficient of activity overlap ( d̂; range: 0 [no overlap] to 1 [complete overlap])
between pregnant and non-pregnant deer at different environmental temperatures and
locations. Drinking activity overlap of pregnant and non-pregnant deer was similar during
periods of lower temperatures (daily mean <35°C; d̂=0.93, CI:0.90-0.94) and higher
temperatures (daily mean >35°C; d̂=0.90, CI:0.87-0.93). However, foraging activity overlap of
pregnant and non-pregnant deer at lower temperatures was 13% greater ( d̂=0.90, CI:0.87-0.92)
than at higher temperatures ( d̂=0.77; CI:0.72-0.82). Moreover, diel activity overlap between
pregnant and non-pregnant deer at shaded feeders was 7% greater at lower temperatures
(d̂=0.92, CI: 0.90-0.95) than higher temperatures ( d̂=0.85, CI: 0.78-0.91), whereas activity
overlap at unshaded feeders was 15% greater at lower temperatures ( d̂=0.91, CI:0.89-0.94)
than higher temperatures ( d̂=0.76, CI:0.68-0.82). Collectively, our results demonstrate
pregnancy has strong effects on diel activity patterns, and those effects are most pronounced at
high temperatures.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1,2024,NA
14,Drivers and Consequences of Mule Deer Site Fidelity in a Highly Dynamic Landscape,"Site fidelity is observed across taxa and predicted to improve familiarity with the
environment and individual or population performance. Human disturbance, however, may alter
the benefit of this previously adaptive behavior. We examined site fidelity of 125 GPS-collared
mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) across four populations in the Texas Panhandle from 2015 –",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1,2024,NA
15,Thermal drivers and consequences of foraging behavior in white-tailed deer,"Foraging behavior is a key determinant of nutritional condition, which governs
individual and population-level performance. Foraging behavior is influenced by numerous
factors; however, little is known about the effect of thermal conditions on foraging behavior or
the physiological consequences of foraging decisions in environments which experience
extreme heat. We investigated how foraging behavior is influenced by environmental
temperature and life history characteristics, and how internal temperature is influenced by
foraging behavior and environmental temperature. We monitored black-body environmental
temperature and internal temperature with temperature-logging vaginal implant transmitters
while conducting a cafeteria-style diet study using captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus; hereafter: “deer”). From April through September 2022, we monitored intake and
diet selection of 35 individuals offered two diets with varying levels of protein and energy. We
used generalized linear mixed models to test the effect of reproductive status, age, sex, and
environmental temperature on daily intake levels and diet selection. We used linear mixed
effects models to evaluate the effect of daily intake, diet selection, and environmental
temperature on internal temperature. Deer selected diets with high energy and low protein
during gestation and post-parturition, antler growth, and juvenile body growth. Additionally, we
observed as environmental temperatures increased, deer reduced overall intake, reduced
protein intake, and increased energy intake. Lastly, we found internal temperature increased as
protein intake increased, revealing a physiological cost to consuming a high-protein diet. Our
results suggest foraging behavior can be strongly influenced by environmental conditions and
induces important physiologic responses in environments prone to extreme heat.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1,2024,NA
16,Behavioral state-specific resource selection of pronghorn in the Texas Panhandle,"Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are a grassland specialist species that have
experienced population declines and range contractions in portions of their distribution as a
result of anthropogenic development and loss of native vegetation communities. Understanding
how pronghorn select resources while in different behavioral states can reveal habitat
requirements for important but infrequent behaviors. We used hidden Markov modeling to
estimate behavioral states—encamped, foraging, and transiting—underlying movement of 72
pronghorn (36 males, 36 females) collared from 2017 – 2019 in the Texas Panhandle. We then
conducted step selection analyses to evaluate behavioral state-specific resource selection for
slope, distance to road, and distance to three landcover types—herbaceous vegetation, woody
vegetation, and cropland. Resource selection differed by behavioral state. Pronghorn spent the
most time foraging (65%), and selected areas with shallower slopes farther from roads and
woody vegetation. Foraging pronghorn exhibited seasonal variation in selection for herbaceous
vegetation, specifically selecting areas closer to herbaceous vegetation during the growing
season and farther from herbaceous vegetation during the dormant season. Pronghorn spent
the least amount of time encamped (10%), and resource selection generally aligned with
selection patterns when foraging. However, when transiting (25%), pronghorn selected areas
closer to roads and exhibited seasonal variation in selection for herbaceous vegetation. Our
findings provide insight into how rangeland composition and configuration influence resource
selection differentially when accounting for pronghorn behavior. Moreover, we highlight that
integrating behavioral modes into resource selection can identify critical habitat associations
that may be less prevalent but biologically important.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1,2024,NA
17,Behavioral State Specific Habitat Selection of Elk in the Trans-Pecos,"Little is known about elk (Cervus canadensis) populations in the Trans-Pecos region
of Texas. Population estimates suggests there could be approximately 3,500 free-ranging
individuals. However, there is minimal information on the dynamics of these populations. These
knowledge gaps have come into sharp focus with increased concern for chronic wasting
disease (CWD) in the Trans-Pecos. Thus, it is essential to understand the epidemiology of CWD
such as space use and drivers of movement in CWD susceptible species such as elk. Pilot data
collected from the first three GPS-collared elk in the Trans-Pecos (captured March 2023)
showed itinerant movement patterns. This instable space use has substantial implications for
disease spread. To further investigate this issue, we used Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to
segment the movement path into encamped and roaming states, then evaluated environmental
drivers of movement in each state using integrated step-selection functions (iSSFs). We found
clear signatures of encamped and roaming behaviors in elk movement patterns, with increased
probability of encampment near stream beds with green vegetation. Our iSSF analysis revealed
that elk movement routes were influenced by topography and shrub cover. Our top model found
that elk in the roaming state selected for landscape concavity (TPI; β = -0.754, SE = 0.0576),
avoided rugged terrain (β = -0.495, SE = 0.4572) and a quadratic term suggested preferred
elevation between 1200m to 1700m.This study provides a method for elk movement pattern
predictions and a basis for future studies to provide insight to CWD transmission pathways in
this understudied population.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1,2024,NA
18,White-tailed Deer Spatial Response to Temporary Bait During Camera Surveys,"Researchers commonly estimate white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)
abundance using bait to attract deer to camera stations. Our objective was to quantify whether
bait (i.e., whole kernel corn) presence and removal impacted home ranges (i.e., size and
overlap) and movement of deer during camera surveys. We conducted our research at Joint
Base San Antonio-Camp Bullis in central Texas from 2012 to 2013. We captured and fitted 64
deer (32 male, 32 female) with GPS collars, which collected 1 GPS location every 15 minutes
from 22 July to 2 September 2012¬–2013. Baited camera surveys were conducted from 5 to 18
of August annually. We evaluated the effect of bait on diurnal and nocturnal daily range size and
overlap of deer using spatial temporal analysis of moving polygons (STAMP). During the bait
period at night, male daily range size (149 ha) was 12% larger than pre-bait (133 ha). During the
bait period, male daily diurnal range overlap (0.15) was 26% lower compared to pre-bait period
(0.20). For females, daily nocturnal range size increased by 21% and overlap decreased by
13% from the pre-bait to bait. Daily distance moved (m) was similar (<6% difference) between
the bait and pre-bait period for both sexes. The presence and removal of bait had minimal
influence on deer space use. Our results suggest that using bait during camera surveys will
have minimal impact on deer daily range characteristics and movement.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 1,2024,NA

meaningful conservation progress with limited resources. Over the past several years, the
NRSP has worked to develop new, objective criteria for determining which species are listed as
Species of Greatest Conservation Need and which qualify as State Threatened. The program
has also developed a novel strategy for identifying key knowledge gaps that need to be filled for

20,Collaborative programs that connect landowners and agencies to do conservation for federally listed and candidate species on private lands,"When the Endangered Species Act was passed by the U.S. Congress 50 years ago,
some viewed the act primarily as a regulatory mechanism, and thus, perceived that interaction
with agencies was best to be avoided. In response to this concern, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service created several programs that encourage and reward voluntary collaboration and
conservation on private lands. Specifically, maintaining or creating populations or habitat for
species that are listed as endangered or threatened, or are a candidate for listing, can come
with assurances for a landowner. Assurances can include authorizing some level of incidental
take and a commitment to ‘no surprises’ for the landowner should changes to the status or
regulations occur for a covered species. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has also
developed several programmatic agreements that streamline the process for landowners who
want to engage in voluntary conservation for federally listed and candidate species on their
lands. This presentation will explore current programs that facilitate voluntary conservation
actions for listed or candidate species, such as Habitat Conservation Plans, Safe Harbor
Agreements, and Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances. We will cover the
features and best applications for each program, as well as provide several examples of current
and ongoing initiatives. The goal of this presentation is to provide landowners, and those who
work with landowners, with a stronger understanding of the tools available for the conservation

21,Non-game Mammal Conservation in Texas,"Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) is charged with ensuring “the
continued ability of nongame species of fish and wildlife to perpetuate themselves successfully”.
As such, the TPWD Mammal Conservation Program focuses on the conservation, research, and

22,Use of Electric Fencing to Deter Bears from Attractants in an Arid Landscape,"Black bears were extirpated from the Trans-Pecos region of Texas by the 1950s but
began recolonizing the region from northern Mexico in the 1980s.  This recolonization has led to
increasing incidents of human-bear conflict.  The prevalence of deer feeders on the Texas
landscape creates a unique challenge because of the increased opportunity for human-bear
conflict.  Two types of deer feeders are common in Texas, free choice deer pellet feeders and
spin-cast feeders.  Since 2018, Texas Parks and Wildlife staff have been testing the use of
electricity to deter bears from feeders.  Systems that utilized an earthen ground return for the
negative circuit were ineffective in the arid environment despite attempts to improve the
grounding system.  Using livestock panels to create a metal apron laid in front of an electric
fence or underneath an electrified spin-cast feeder for the negative circuit have proven effective.
A 7-wire all hot fence (~34 inches tall) with a metal grounding apron successfully deterred bears
using energizers rated at 0.15-0.25 output joules.  Likewise, electrified spin-cast feeders with a
metal grounding apron successfully prevented feeder damage using energizers rated at 0.08-
0.20 output joules.  A third design entailed adding a single hot wire positioned 2-3 inches above
and 2-3 inches inside of an existing hog panel or netwire fence.  Using 0.15-0.25 output joule
energizers, this design successfully deterred as well.   We discuss the efficacy of these designs
in securing various black bear attractants in the Trans-Pecos region and other arid landscapes.",oral,Non-Game and Rare Species Conservation from TPWD,2024,NA
23,Historical Changes in The Distribution of Montezuma Quail In Texas (1850-1950),"Understanding the history of a species’ geographical range is fundamental to
establishing context for its present condition and developing realistic approaches to its
management and conservation. Unfortunately, there is very little documented information in the
published literature about the historical Texas distribution of Montezuma Quail (Cyrtonyx
montezumae) a Species of Greatest Conservation Need. Generally, published depictions of
Montezuma Quail distributions are without documentation. I addressed this problem by
assembling a database of dated and geo-referenced voucher specimens (n = 54) and
occurrence records (n = 136) of Montezuma Quail to assess spatial and temporal patterns of
Texas distributions through historical time (1850-1950). Historical records revealed that in 1850
Montezuma Quail occupied a large and diverse landscape encompassing 125,745 km2 across
8 distinct macro-scale terrain-vegetation frameworks. The Texas distribution consisted of 2
units—a mostly contiguous central Texas unit centered on the Edwards Plateau and a highly
fragmented Trans-Pecos unit associated with plateaus, cuestas, and rugged desert mountain
ranges with ≥1,400 m elevation. The 1850 central Texas and Trans-Pecos distributions covered
an estimated 109,320 km2 and 16,425 km2, respectively. Beginning in the 1880s, the central
Texas distribution underwent a rapid and dramatic contraction that reduced its former expansive
range to 2,399 km2. By the 1930s, Montezuma Quail were reduced to relict populations in parts
of several counties along the western end of the southern Balcones Escarpment. In contrast,
the Trans-Pecos distribution of Montezuma Quail remained essentially unchanged over the
historical period, being extirpated from the Franklin Mountains and possibly some marginal, low
elevation areas. The records-based data presented in this paper provide firm evidence of the
former robustness and subsequent plight of Montezuma Quail in Texas. I propose that
Montezuma Quail need greater conservation effort and give broad recommendations for its
future management.",oral,Non-Game and Rare Species Conservation from TPWD,2024,NA
24,Monitoring and learning the urban ecosystem with iNaturalist,"The urban ecosystems in Texas are filled with biodiversity, and one of our challenges
as wildlife biologists and nature enthusiasts is to learn about the flora and fauna that make up
these cities and towns.  In many cases, the urban ecosystems are composed of native,
naturalized, and invasive species.  To manage these properly, it's important to learn the
identifications of all of the components of these areas.  One of the most powerful tools that we
can use is iNaturalist, a citizen science social network that uses both an automated species
identification and a community of naturalists to verify these identifications.  Not only does the
repetition of observing organisms add valuable data to our knowledge of global biodiversity, but
it also aids in the natural resource management of the area.  By using iNaturalist regularly, a
wildlife biologist and nature enthusiast can generate a substantial knowledge about the entire
ecosystem.  We will discuss the importance of using this tool and how to gain the most out of
regular use, especially in the urban ecosystem.",oral,Non-Game and Rare Species Conservation from TPWD,2024,NA
25,Responses of Riparian Vegetation Before and After Ashe Juniper Removal,"Woody encroachment of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) is an ongoing problem in
many Texas riparian areas. Studies on the responses of ecosystems to removal of Ashe juniper
indicate that the response could be specific to heavy disturbance. Our study occurs at a tract of
land undergoing restoration in north-central Texas in the Crosstimbers ecoregion (Palo Pinto
Mountain State Park; opens to public access 2024). Our objective is to examine the effect of
Ashe juniper removal and the subsequent disturbance on riparian vegetation for 3–5 years post-
removal. Restoration began in phases in 2020. A contracted company initiated mechanical
removal of Ashe juniper from multiple riparian areas. In 2022 we initiated reseeding efforts of
herbaceous ground cover following removal. In removal areas, we measure stem counts,
canopy cover, and herbaceous cover 1 year prior to removal and 3–5 years post-removal. Our
study is a before-after treatment design that we analyze using a two-way nested ANOVA.
Preliminary results from phase 1, 2 years post-removal and phase 2, 1-year post-removal
suggest slight trends towards wood vegetation recovery, but a potential delayed response by
the herbaceous cover due to an increase in litter coverage. In summer 2023, we collected
another year of post-treatment data, which will include results from our reseeding efforts. Our
results inform immediate restoration activities, such as the decision to initiate reseeding efforts
with removal of litter cover, and provide more understanding about community-level responses

26,Long-term Vegetation Dynamics on a Semi-arid Multiple-use Landscape,"Vegetation-environmental relationships are difficult to discriminate, as are drivers of
floral change. Multi-year monitoring of spatially congruent sites can ascertain the direction and
cause of floristic shifts. Our objective was to assess long-term vegetation change on a multiple
use military installation in eastern New Mexico using ground-sampling techniques. A modified
point-intercept method was used to obtain species frequency and foliar height data at 45 plots
across 6 sampling periods from 2008 to 2021. We used redundancy analysis and canonical
analysis of principal coordinates to assess gradients of floristic change and plot-level
spatiotemporal differences. Soil composition and annual microclimate were the drivers of
species presence and frequency (R2 = 0.41, p < 0.001), and plot-level analysis showed minimal
cyclic movement but no unidirectional shifts. Plot composition weakly differed across periods
with rainfall disparities but were similar between years with comparable microclimate (R = 0.09,
p < 0.0001). Plot composition moderately differed across maneuver areas (R = 0.36, p <
0.0001) but were not significantly different in maneuver areas with similar soils and land use.
Our results indicate that soil characteristics drive presence whereas annual weather patterns
influence prevalence, and no permanent state change has occurred across the 13-year time
span. Future monitoring efforts should focus on quantifying anthropogenic management
activities and their influence on composition shifts. Our study approach can assist land
managers using a variety of sampling metrics in assessing site-specific long-term changes in
vegetation composition and validate state-and-transition models currently used by land

factors including urbanization, intensive agriculture, and climate change. Current climate models
suggest increased frequency and severity of drought events in North-Central Texas, which
reduces wild floral resources in areas that are already limited by other factors in the landscape.
Pollinator syndromes are thought to give a general idea of the types of flowers involved in
attracting different pollinators and are based on suites of floral cues and morphologies.
Biologists can improve the integrity of ecosystem services provided by pollinators by providing
environmentally robust floral resources in anthropogenic landscapes. Understanding pollinator
attractiveness to plants is crucial for providing quality floral resources in urban landscapes. The
purpose of our study is to understand pollinator preference and resource use associated with
drought-tolerant, commercially available landscape perennials and to determine the efficacy of
pollinator syndromes in North-Central Texas. We established 4, 8.5 x 14-m plots with 3, 2 x 14-
m rows containing 20 perennial plant taxa. We conducted weekly observations from May to
November 2022 and recorded pollinator visitors during 60 second observations at each plant.
Using bipartite network indices, we found evidence of preference by pollinator groups generally
consistent with traditional pollinator syndromes and identified commercially available landscape
perennials attractive to pollinator groups. Our findings recommend selecting plant species for
pollinator conservation in urban areas where water resources may be limited as well as
promoting a suite of robust flowering perennials for consideration in restoration or conservation
plantings.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management,2024,NA
28,The Power of Rocks: Ecohydrology Improvements for Habitat Restoration,"The decline of scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) populations has been mainly
attributed to habitat degradation. Increasing plant diversity and reducing soil erosion could help
alleviate habitat challenges. Therefore, we have deployed a holistic strategy to restore riparian
habitat within the Chihuahuan Desert by building structures known as “trincheras” (small rock
dams) to improve hydrological processes. We expect restoration efforts to increase water
harvest, reduce soil erosion, increase native vegetation, and positively affect soil cover and
retention. Restoration efforts began in August of 2021 in a private ranch in Southern Brewster
County. To date, we have built 130 trincheras. Of those, 50 have been assessed before and
after the rainy seasons of 2022 and 2023 to measure how much soil was retained. We used a
Functional Principal Component Analysis to determine how sediments accumulated where
trincheras were established. As a result, we found significant accumulation up to and beyond
2m upstream from trincheras. Also, we observed negligible loss of sediments downstream to a
distance of 0.5m from the trinchera. Variability in the capture of soil sediments may be related to
stream features like slope, soil type, and channel size. This study can guide placement and
expectations of ecohydrology improvements, leading to more effective habitat restoration. By
increasing soil deposition in riparian areas, trincheras are an effective tool to promote plant
production and ground cover in the short term.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management,2024,NA
29,A biologist’s review of ESRI field data collecting apps: selecting the best tool for your needs,"ESRI (maker of ArcGIS products) commands a large share of the GIS market and
has produced a variety of apps biologists can use for field data collection. However, it is
sometimes difficult to discern the nuances between apps and the license levels needed for
each. We discuss the pros/ cons of the following apps: Field Maps, Survey 123, and Quick
Capture. Field Maps is a map-centric app that excels at collecting points, lines and polygons
quickly, while offering a basemap for navigation. Survey 123 is form-centric, and best to use
when extensive amounts of data are being gathered on the fly at each location. Quick Capture
is a newer option with buttons to collect data quickly and on the fly with minimal user training
and input. We cover the current license levels offered by ESRI and explain what levels are
required for creation of maps to use in each app, and if additional licenses are required for data
collecting staff. All ESRI apps utilize on board GPS capabilities of the user’s device but are
improved with the use of an external Bluetooth connected GPS unit. After using all three apps in
the field, we believe that Survey 123 is the easiest for a beginner to design and use while still
offering versatility. Use of these data collection apps will streamline post processing and reduce
user error from mis-entered data. Understanding the options available and the costs required
will allow biologists to choose the best setup for their projects and budget.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management,2024,NA
30,Updates and Advancements for Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas,"Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas (EMSTX) consist of a 411 class, land
classification map for Texas. Each EMSTX type is uniquely identified based on vegetation
community and landcover.  As well as, geological influences, landforms, and soil type. Land
cover is determined from photo interpretation of satellite imagery in addition to species-specific,
ground-collected plot data to distinguish between herbaceous, shrubland, and woodland/forest
types. Ground data collection consists primarily of roadside plots where % cover and dominant
species are recorded for trees, shrubs, and herbaceous cover. To further improve EMSTX
mapping accuracy, geophysical settings using soil Map Units from the gSSURGO data and
LIDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) were introduced. Using 10-meter imagery, rules
for the classification of each EMS type followed the format: land cover + abiotic factors =
mapped EMS type. In 2014, more than 12,000 spatially specific, ground samples were obtained
in support of previous mapping efforts (85% accuracy) and system descriptions. With new
efforts already underway, significant improvements are evident in both spatial and thematic
resolution, including the high resolution mapping of canyons, mapping forest classes based on
height, and assessing fine-scale grassland quality on a regional level. With numerous
applications for a statewide update to this dataset, the implications for both TPWD and partners
include an improved tool for improved land stewardship, landscape change detection, as well as
conservation planning and management efforts.",oral,Natural Resources Management/Habitat Management,2024,NA
31,Habitat Loss and the Behavioral Effects on a Female Gray Hawk in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas,"Habitat loss is a major threat to wildlife worldwide. Though we typically associate
habitat loss with the degradation of large tracts of suitable space, habitat loss in urban
environments can be much more incremental. We tracked an adult female Gray Hawk (Buteo
plagiatus) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas before and after 70% of the trees (7.6 ha)
were cleared from her core breeding territory and used a hidden Markov model to infer two
behavioral states from her movements. While her overall activity budget between within-patch
and exploratory movements was unchanged, she undertook substantially longer exploratory
movements after the clearcut. These longer movements likely resulted in higher energetic costs
and exposed her to additional anthropogenic threats, such as roads. Road exposure within her
territory increased from 7 km to 547 km following the clearcut.  Preserving natural areas and
enhancing wildlife-friendly features in urban green spaces could facilitate adaptation of species
like the Gray Hawk to increasingly urban environments. Our study highlights the behavioral
effects of seemingly minor habitat loss on a highly mobile predator; however, impacts could be
far more severe in species with limited mobility.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2,2024,NA
32,Escape Cover Use by Multiple Quail Species in Response to Raptor Predation,"Habitat management is important for conservation of quail, but predator-specific
escape cover use is poorly understood. To better understand this habitat requirement, I
collected escape cover use data for Gambel’s (Callipepla gambelii), scaled (Callipepla
squamata), and Montezuma (Cyrtonyx montezumae) quail pursued by trained falconry hawks
during 171 hunting trials in winter 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 in Arizona and New Mexico.
Gambel’s quail and scaled quail used middens (21.3% and 27.6%, respectively) and
rabbit/squirrel holes (14.9% and 12.1%, respectively) for escape similarly. Middens and holes
were usually associated with woody shrubs and cactus. Woody shrub cover, however, was the
primary escape cover by Gambel’s (53.2%) and scaled (29.3) quail and additional holes may
have been undetected. Grass was the only escape cover used by Montezuma quail (100%). My
data suggests middens and holes are used by Gambel’s and scaled quail in 36.2 – 39.7% of
successful escapes from raptor predation, but where not used by Montezuma quail. Although
untested so far, falconers believe that the same middens and holes are used repeatedly across
the season, suggesting quail know where the safe escape covers are within their activity areas.
This suggests that midden building rodents and hole burrowing mammals, and the features they
construct, are important to consider in a community context when managing for quail habitat.
Additional data are being collected for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) during November
2023 – January 2024 and will be included in the final results.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2,2024,NA
33,Changes in Avian Community Structure Following Prescribed Thinning of Pinyon- Juniper Woodlands in New Mexico,"Pinyon-juniper woodlands are a vital vegetation community for ecosystem health and
biodiversity throughout the western United States. However, woodland stand characteristics
have been impacted by historical grazing practices, fire suppression, and climate change,
facilitating woody encroachment into landscapes that were predominantly open grassland
savannas. In response, large-scale thinning and prescribed burning efforts are underway to
restore stand densities and patterns while reducing hazardous fuel loads. However, these
efforts must consider potential impacts to both pinyon-juniper obligate and grassland-nesting
birds. To develop a better scientific understanding of how avian communities change following
common woodland thinning approaches, we have partnered with the US Fish and Wildlife
Service and Bureau of Land Management to conduct a long-term avian monitoring study in
Lincoln County, New Mexico. We stratified random sampling across gradients of thinning
intensities and utilized detection probability survey methods during 2018-2023 to assess
changes over time in woodland bird communities associated with specific thinning treatments.
This ongoing collaboration aims to provide key insights into species-specific and ecological
community responses to woodland thinning. Ultimately, this research will provide data to
facilitate informed policies and management decisions focused on balancing ecological
restoration of pinyon-juniper ecosystems with avian conservation priorities on public forest
lands.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2,2024,NA
34,Productivity and Nest Survival of White-Tailed Hawks in South Texas During the 2021-2023 Breeding Season,"The white-tailed hawk (Geranoaetus albicaudatus) is a neotropical bird of prey with a
restricted breeding range concentrated in the coastal bend region of Texas. Population
estimates and demographics are largely unknown, which pushes the state-threatened listing of
this species. Previous estimates of white-tailed hawk nesting success show high spatial and
latitudinal variability. More investigation of their breeding ecology and nest success throughout
the Gulf Coast of Texas is necessary to expand our current understanding of productivity and
inform conservation planning for the species. We observed 80% breeding success from
monitoring 40 different white-tailed hawk nests along the coast in south Texas during the 2021
and 2022 breeding seasons. From 40 adult pairs, 0.677 nestlings were produced per breeding
attempt, and 0.581 nestlings survived to fledge per breeding attempt. We found that the
estimated daily survival rate probability increased in relation to nest height (mean = 3.54 m).
The daily nest survival estimate for all nests pooled was 0.9969 (95% CI = 0.9898– 0.9990),
which translates to an estimated nest survival of 77.8%. These results are at the high end of
previously reported estimates. This could be attributed to the broad spatial distribution of our
sample that may conceal any localized patterns of nesting failure, or to the temporal period in
which we collected data compared to studies conducted previously. Data collection regarding
nest survival is ongoing for the 2023 breeding season. Future analyses will investigate potential
variation in nest survival, incorporating environmental factors and latitude.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2,2024,NA
35,American Kestrel Nest Survival and Productivity Across a Decade in the Southern High Plains of Texas,"American kestrel (Falco sparverius) populations are declining across much of North
America and it is a species of increasing conservation concern. One region in which the species
appears stable is in the shortgrass prairie of the Southern High Plains. In this region, we have
monitored occupancy and reproduction of American Kestrels in a nest box program from 2014 –
2023 in Lubbock County TX. Among 32 initial nest boxes, we observed an occupancy increase
from 12% during the first year of the nest box program to as much as 73% in subsequent years.
From 2014 – 2022 (data for 2023 is pending for analysis and inclusion) we monitored 158
known fate nest attempts. Observed nest success from 2014 – 2022 averaged 79%, but the
modeled daily survival rate averaged 0.9954 (range = 0.9911 to 0.9979), with modelled nest
survival averaging 76.5% (± 8.3). Across 10 breeding seasons, average clutch size was 4.6
eggs (± 0.32), with 3.8 (± 0.41) nestlings per hatched clutch, and 3.3 (± 0.51) fledglings per
successful nest; 391 fledglings were produced during the 2014 – 2022 study period. Kestrel
populations across the nation that use artificial cavities are experiencing nest success rates of
49 – 73%. Our population has high nest success which might be due to suspected site- and
pair-fidelity and the nesting experience of pairs, favorable climate, and extended breeding
season. We will include 2023 data for a final analysis of productivity and examination of multiple
covariates to better assess daily nest survival.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2,2024,NA
36,An Experimental Investigation of the Influence of Green Plant Material in Raptor Nest Microclimate,"Many raptor species place green plant material on their nests during incubation and
nestling rearing periods. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this behavior; the
generally accepted, but unconfirmed, explanation is that greenery functions as a repellent to
ectoparasites. We examined the alternative hypothesis that fresh greenery may meaningfully
modify the microclimate of raptor nests. Our study species was the Mississippi Kite (Ictinia
mississippiensis). We predicted that addition of fresh greenery would 1) increase humidity at
nests, 2) decrease temperature at nests, 3) provisioning of greenery would be correlated to
periods of low humidity and high temperature, and 4) tree species used for greenery would
release more moisture per unit volume compared to species not used. We created 25 simulated
Mississippi Kite nests within a controlled environment. 5 were control nests, and we added
treatments consisting of 4 local tree species to 5 nests each, monitoring the temperature and
humidity levels over 17 hours. Running a Hedges test with the collected data demonstrated a
significant difference in temperature and humidity levels within the treatment nests, with all
treatments having periods of g>1.0. A changing climate is resulting in increasing aridity and
temperatures, especially in already arid regions. Low humidity and high temperature have been
demonstrated to reduce nest success of raptors. We have demonstrated that addition of as little
as 5 g of greenery can have meaningful influences on nest microclimate. This provides insight
into a behavior that could contribute to species longevity, even with a changing climate.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 2,2024,NA
37,Monitoring Changes in Northern Bobwhite Density over 10 years within a Large- scale Experimental Grazing Study in South Texas,"In South Texas, northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) occur on lands where
grazing and hunting are integral to the ranch’s viability and longevity. Identifying a causal
relationship between cattle grazing and bobwhite density requires consideration of precipitation,
range productivity, management type, and historical land use, among other variables. In 2014, a
large-scale monitoring project was developed on an East Foundation ranch in Jim Hogg County,
TX, to observe annual bobwhite density over a 7,505-ha grazing treatment area. Prior to 2014,
the area was heavily grazed by cattle. Grazing was removed from 2014–2015. From January
2016 to May 2018, grazing was applied at one of two fixed stock densities within management
units, either continuously (n = 4 management units) or rotationally (n = 6 units). In 2018, cattle
were removed due to extreme drought. Grazing was deferred from May 2018 through October",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 3,2024,NA
38,Predicted Habitat Overlap Between Montezuma Quail and Feral Pigs in the Davis Mountains of West Texas,"Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are highly intelligent, adaptive ecological generalists that
affect many ecosystems through rooting. This foraging behavior disturbs the soil, which
potentially reduces plant cover, alters soil composition, and ultimately causes nutrient loss and
altered vegetation communities that other native species depend upon. There is concern about
the damage to sensitive ecosystems that occur predominantly in the sky islands of West Texas.
Sky islands generate topographically diverse habitats that occur along an elevational-climatic
gradient that many species thrive in, including the Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae) in
the Davis Mountains (Jeff Davis Co.). Across their range, overgrazing has been identified as
one of the biggest contributing factors to population decline due to loss of ground cover and
reduced forage availability. We fit a beta regression model, from collected presence data, to
predict presence of feral pigs across the entire range of the Davis Mountains. Once we created
a raster of predicted feral pig presence, we were able to calculate a predicted overlap of 51% for
feral pig presence and predicted Montezuma quail habitat in the Davis Mountains (Sauer 2018).
Feral pig presence doesn’t completely overlap with predicted Montezuma quail habitat but
occurs in areas that are considered critical for Montezuma quail when their populations are low
and resources are scarce. This opens the door to question if feral pigs might have an effect on
Montezuma quail resources and habitats.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 3,2024,NA
39,"Winter Habitat Selection and Movement Behavior of Scaled Quail in the Trans- Pecos, Texas","Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) have experienced population declines in the last
several decades, primarily attributed to habitat degradation. Changes in habitat composition
compound seasonal reductions in resources, such as those occurring during winter. In the
Trans-Pecos region, winter presents scaled quail with reduced food and cover availability. As
these factors can prompt behavioral responses to resultant changes in habitat quality,
monitoring spatial behaviors can lend insight into how scaled quail respond to winter conditions.
We hypothesize that scaled quail will use supplemental resources and select for hydrologic
features that offer greater availability of food, cover and thermal refuge. We trapped scaled quail
in southern Brewster County, Texas during winter 2022-2023 using walk-in funnel traps and fit
them with Global Positioning System (GPS) backpacks to obtain winter location data. We
captured 314 scaled quail during the study period and deployed GPS backpacks on 37 scaled
quail (22 Female, 15 Male). We modelled scaled quail habitat selection and movement using
integrated Step Selection Analysis. Covariates included distance to quail feeders, Topographic
Position Index (TPI), monthly Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), and the effect
of ambient temperature on step length and selection of hydrologic features. We explored
interindividual variation in selection behaviors using Principal Component Analysis of selection
coefficients generated from step selection functions. Results from this study will provide novel
insights into scaled quail’s response to winter conditions.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 3,2024,NA
40,Genetic Structure and Variation of Wild Turkey in Oklahoma,"Global change due to anthropogenic pressures has led to biodiversity loss and shifts
in wildlife population dynamics.  These pressures have led to habitat loss, species declines, and
alterations in population structure.  These ecological and environmental changes are notably
occurring within the Great Plains, USA biome, where state transitions driven by altered
ecological processes are restructuring biological communities.  For instance, wild turkey
(Meleagris gallopavo) populations within this biome have exhibited range-wide population
declines because of habitat loss and fragmentation.  Population decline and reduced
connectivity may severely affect population structure.  Furthermore, environmental change may
prompt fluctuations in structure and geographic distribution among subspecies, influencing
levels of hybridization and introgression.  Finally, active management, such as translocations,
has had uneven success in restoration of populations.  In this study, we will assess the genetic
diversity and differentiation of wild turkey populations across Oklahoma and evaluate the extent
of hybridization between subspecies and the influence of translocations on population structure.
We collected tissue samples from hunter-harvested birds statewide during 2022 and 2023 and
generated low-coverage (18x) whole-genome sequence data for 160 individuals from 52
counties.  Analysis of genomic data will illustrate current statewide population structure as well
as examine the relationship between Rio Grande and Eastern subspecies.  Assessments of
genomic diversity will provide further inspection of genetic composition and differentiation within
and between populations across the state.  Through evaluating current genetic structure, this
study aims to offer insights toward informing future management of wild turkey within the region.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 3,2024,NA
41,Landscape Assessment of Wild Turkey Roosting Habitat and Change in the Texas Rolling Plains,"Rio Grande wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) populations in the Rolling
Plains of Texas have remained depressed following drought that lasted from 2010 to 2014.
Across most semi-arid rangelands, Rio Grande wild turkey distribution is strongly dependent on
the availability of roosting habitat. Thus, loss or alteration of roosting habitat is an increasing
concern during the last decade due to its potential impacts on wild turkeys in the Rolling Plains.
Our goal was to assess the changes in land use and cover and identify the habitat
characteristics that drive roost site selection of wild turkeys across Bird Conservation Region 19
(BCR 19). We used satellite imagery and ground control points to assess landscape change
from 2004 to 2021. Furthermore, we used roost site location data obtained from 3 empirical
datasets across BCR 19 and random forest models to predict roost site habitat across the
region. Our results indicated that tree cover increased by almost 20% from 2004 to 2021, while
invasive tree cover decreased throughout this period by 22.2-47.2%. Our roost site selection
model, using data from 2017 to 2018, indicated that turkeys selected roost sites with >4% tree
cover and exclusively within flood plains. Additionally, turkeys selected roost sites with 40-60%
perennial forb and grass cover and 15-30% woody shrub cover. Our results provide valuable
insight into roost site selection characteristics for wild turkeys. Future efforts will link landscape
change to roosting habitat amount and distribution to better understand how roost site
availability may impact wild turkey populations.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 3,2024,NA
42,Seasonality of Competition Potential Between Desert Bighorn and Mule Deer on Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area,"Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area (EMWMA) serves as a nursery herd
for ongoing desert bighorn (Ovis canadensis) restoration efforts. Consequently, the primary
management objective is production of surplus animals for use as source stock for
translocation. However, EMWMA also provides public hunting opportunities, particularly for
mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Thus, maintaining a healthy mule deer population is also a
key management goal on EMWMA. The area is unique in the high degree of spatial overlap
between the two species, presumably leading to competition for resources. However, seasonal
shifts in space use by each species may exacerbate or curtail competition. Our goal was to
identify potential seasonality in both space use and resource competition between species. In
March 2023, we deployed Global Positioning System collars on 30 bighorn sheep and 24 mule
deer to investigate temporal patterns of space use. We fit monthly Brownian bridge utilization
distributions (UDs) to the movement path of each individual, then combined them to produce
monthly UDs at the species level. We then measured overlap between species each month
using Bhattacharya’s Affinity (BA). Finally, we modeled seasonality of overlap between groups
with periodic beta regression models. We found evidence of seasonality in spatial overlap, with
maximum overlap during July (BA = 0.59) and minimum overlap during October (BA = 0.40).
Our results suggest seasonality of bighorn space use is driven by social behaviors (e.g. rut), but
may mitigate potential for resource competition with mule deer at EMWMA.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2,2024,NA
43,Survival and recruitment of white-tailed deer fawns in South Texas,"In large mammals, recruitment is a significant determinant of population growth and
influenced by environmental stochasticity, yet the drivers are poorly understood. In white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), fawn survival is typically the most dynamic parameter influencing
variation in recruitment and understanding drivers of survival is important for managing
populations. We studied survival and cause-specific mortality of fawns in a deer population not
exposed to predator control, supplemental feed, or harvest on the East Foundation’s San
Antonio Viejo Ranch in South Texas, USA. We captured and radio-collared white-tailed deer
fawns at birth by monitoring pregnant adult females equipped with vaginal implant transmitters,
and at approximately 4-months and 8-months-old via aerial net-gunning during 2020-2023. We
captured 222 fawns and monitored individuals until death or loss of collar. We determined cause
of death using molecular and observational field evidence. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 12-week
survival across the 4 years ranged from 30-35%, and 1-year survival ranged from 12-24%.
Coyotes (Canis latrans) were the primary cause of mortality, accounting for almost half of the
documented mortalities, but bobcats (Lynx rufus) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa) also killed fawns. In
southern Texas, coyotes are suggested as the most dominant predator of fawns. Most mortality
events occurred during the first 5 weeks of life and during late winter (February-March). The
high winter mortality was unexpected but coincided with poor range conditions and extreme
temperatures. Our low fawn survival estimates suggest annual survival of adult female deer
must be high to sustain populations on southern Texas rangelands.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2,2024,NA
44,Assessing Temporal Space Use Stability in the Trans-Pecos Black Bear Population,"The recolonizing west Texas black bear (Ursus americanus) population has
increased over the last 25 years, with a dramatic increase in the past 5 years, posing new
challenges to managers and residents. Monitoring the abundance and distribution of
recolonizing black bears is essential to understand the progression of recolonization and inform
potential areas of human-bear conflict. Most abundance estimators assume a closed population,
which is difficult to satisfy when a population is expanding its range and navigating stochastic
environmental patterns in this unique desert environment. However, because bear behavior is
highly seasonal, appropriate timing of sampling may satisfy the closure assumption. We
examined temporal patterns of space use stability (SUS) among 21 GPS-collared black bears
(6F, 15M) in the Trans-Pecos starting Oct 2022. We generated comparative metrics between
successive weekly Brownian bridge utilization distributions for each individual, including
Pianka's niche overlap ( x̅ = 0.19, SD = 0.26), peak to peak distance ( x̅ = 66.19 km, SD = 115.37
km), and 95% isopleth area ( x̅ = 77021.25 km2, SD = 98771.78 km2). We used ~600 records in
a 2-state hidden Markov model to delineate periods of high and low SUS. While temporal
patterns were evident, bear space use was highly unstable in this population. The proportion of
bears in the stable state was highest from mid-December to mid-May; therefore, population
closure may be a tenable assumption during this time. These results will aid management in
planning accurate population monitoring and will provide a better understanding of patterns in
bear recolonization.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2,2024,NA
45,Fine-scale behavioral patterns of newly recolonizing black bears in West Texas,"Black bears (Ursus americanus) began recolonizing West Texas in the late 1980s
after being extirpated from the state in the 1950s. Despite their protected status, little is known
about this population or the rate and extent of recolonization, and information on their behavioral
patterns is severely lacking. To that end, we collared 20 bears with GPS collars programmed
with 2-hour fix rates. Using hidden Markov models (HMMs) we segmented the movement paths
of 19 bears (13 M, 6 F) into 4 behavioral states based on probability distributions of step lengths
(SL), turning angles, residence times, and revisitation rates. Two states reflected dispersive
movement behaviors ( x̅SL = 245.31 ± 7.03 (SE), 1054.81 ± 53.33) and two states reflected
localized movement behaviors ( x̅SL = 12.87 ± 0.63, 3.88 ± 0.14). The probabilities of remaining
in both dispersive movement states were higher (77% ± 0.01, 71% ± 0.02) than remaining in
either localized movement state (51% ± 0.03, 52% ± 0.02). We then examined the influence of
environmental covariates on the transition probabilities between states to investigate which
abiotic and biotic factors influence where bears make specific behavioral decisions.
Understanding drivers behind bear behaviors can improve our ability to predict future behaviors
in novel environments as they continue their recolonization and allow us to predict future conflict
areas. Additionally, understanding habitat characteristics associated with these behavioral
processes will be crucial for identifying key areas in need of protection for long-term population
viability.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2,2024,NA
46,Fire as a driver of bobcat occupancy in East Texas,"Prescribed fire is an important tool in forest management that reduces fuel loads,
maintains historical disturbance regimes, alters vegetation structure, and influences wildlife
communities. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are the largest obligate carnivore in many fire-dependent
forested ecosystems in the southeastern USA and therefore are an ideal species to assess the
effects of fire on wildlife communities. To examine the influence of fire on bobcat occupancy in a
frequently burned ecosystem, we deployed 40 remote cameras on the Boggy Slough
Conservation Area in eastern Texas. We collected occurrence data from July to September
2023 and linked these data to landcover and fire history within a 500 m buffer around each
camera site. We used fire records from 2015-2023 to calculate the time since most recent fire,
mean fire return interval, number of fires, and proportion of area burned. Landcover was
categorized as natural pine, planted pine, hardwood forest, or open. We fit occupancy models
using landcover and fire history covariates and compared models using AICc. Bobcat
occupancy was best predicted by fire history and the probability of occupancy increased with
the proportion of area burned (p=0.05). The probability of detection was greatest in natural pine
suggesting bobcats may be more active in this cover type. As an apex predator in our system,
bobcat occupancy can be used as an indicator of the response to forest management by wildlife
species across trophic levels. Our results suggest prescribed fire created forest conditions that
improved habitat quality for bobcats.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 2,2024,NA
47,Understanding the Diet of an Unmanaged Population of Coyotes in Southern Texas,"Understanding the diet of a species is crucial for effective wildlife management.
Predator selection of prey items can strongly influence the population dynamics and food
availability of other wildlife. One such species is the coyote (Canis latrans), whose great dietary
plasticity can variably impact other species. With increasing urbanization and changes in land
use nationwide, researchers focus on evaluating coyote diet within these contexts. However,
understanding coyote diet in a large-scale wildland with a lack of human intervention can
provide insight into management on similar properties. Our study aimed to evaluate the diet of a
coyote population in southern Texas where no native wildlife is managed by harvesting,
trapping, or supplemental feeding and compare it to previous studies involving human
intervention. We collected coyote scat from 20 one kilometer transects on the roads of the East
Foundation's San Antonio Viejo Ranch every month of 2021. Prey items were morphologically
analyzed using relative volume based on a grid system. Overall, we identified 22 unique species
with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and feral pig (Sus scrofa) being the most
consumed with a dietary shift to vegetation in the fall months. The high proportion of ungulates
consumed year long as opposed to high proportions of lagomorphs and rodents shows a
distinguishing difference of this study. Further research may be conducted to identify the

48,Monitoring highway mitigation structures for ocelots and bobcats,"Roads can have significant impacts on wildlife, including on bobcats (Lynx rufus) and
ocelots (Leopardus pardalis). In the United States, the ocelot is an endangered species with
vehicle collisions as the leading known cause of mortality. Therefore, road mitigation for ocelots
is critically important to conservation of ocelots in the United States. In South Texas, road
mitigation structures for ocelots, including wildlife crossings are being constructed for ocelot
conservation. As part of this effort, monitoring felid populations pre-, during-, and post-
construction of these mitigation structures is critical to assessing their effectiveness and
determining road impacts on ocelots. Ocelots, however, are rare on the landscape so bobcats
are used as surrogate species to understand ecological impacts of roads on ocelots. We are
monitoring bobcat and ocelot populations around US Highway 77 in Willacy and Kenedy
Counties with camera traps, GPS collars, and wildlife road mortality surveys to understand how
construction of road mitigation structures for wildlife impact habitat use of road areas, including
wildlife crossings by bobcats and ocelots. One wildlife crossing is complete on US 77 and nine
more will be constructed over the next 10 years. We have documented high populations of and
regular wildlife crossing use by bobcats living in the area. We are recording interactions of
bobcats with this wildlife crossing considering 4 different behaviors: full crossing, entry/exit,
approach, and in the area. This work will help the Texas Department of Transportation improve
designs of road mitigation for wildlife and help support ocelot conservation efforts throughout
Texas.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3,2024,NA
49,Development of an Improved Survey Method for the Texas Kangaroo Rat,"The Texas kangaroo rat (Dipodomys elator) currently inhabits five counties in
Texas. Habitat fragmentation and changing vegetation patterns are believed to be responsible
for the reduction of the population such that it is currently a state threatened species under
petition for federal protection. The species rarity and nocturnal activity periods result in them
being difficult to survey, monitor, and study. We tested different approaches to develop a
repeatable and reliable survey method for these elusive animals. We used the more abundant
Ord’s kangaroo rat (D. ordii) as a proxy for Texas kangaroo rats due to the species similarity.
Our survey trials were conducted on transects set along roads, two-tracks, and in open fields.
On roads we tested driving with headlights and spotlights, and walking surveys using spotlights
or thermal scopes. On two-tracks and open fields we tested using spotlights and thermals
scopes. We also conducted burrow surveys as an indirect measure of kangaroo rats. We are
assessing the different methods on basis of detection probabilities with covariates of moon
phase, time, temperature, and cloud cover. Our results should provide guidance to optimize
survey methods for Texas kangaroo rats, and serve to facilitate improved surveys and
monitoring of this elusive species.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3,2024,NA
50,Small Mammal Population Dynamics Across a Native-Invaded Habitat Gradient,"Invasive and non-native vegetation can result in reduced ecosystem function
presumably due to the loss of native plant diversity. Historically, open rangelands of southern
Texas have been invaded by non-native grasses and native, woody shrubs. Small mammals
play numerous vital roles in ecosystems; however, little is known of their response to invasive
vegetation and habitat change in south Texas. To evaluate small mammal population dynamics
across a native-invaded habitat gradient, we sampled small mammals at the Welder Wildlife
Refuge in San Patricio County, Texas, USA. We sampled across six plots: two consisted of
native vegetation, two consisted of invasive vegetation, and two intermediate plots. Data were
collected from 2019-2023 and we recorded 3,206 captures of 9 small mammal species. To
determine the potential influence of invasive vegetation, we compared relative abundance
between each plot for three species (Sigmodon hispidus, Baiomys taylori, and Reithrodontomys
fulvescens). For all three species, we found no significant difference in relative abundance
between the three levels of plant invasion. However, we observed significant differences in
relative abundance between survey season and study years. South Texas rangelands
experience frequent droughts which are known to alter vegetation and small vertebrate
populations. We observed that the relative abundance of small mammal species was lowest
following droughts, which suggests a lag effect on small mammal populations. Therefore,
drought cycling may play a more significant role in regulating small mammal populations than
vegetation structure alone.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3,2024,NA
51,Mapping Collared Peccary Habitat: Species Distribution Modeling in the South Texas Plains & Trans-Pecos Ecoregions,"Collared peccary (hereafter peccary; Pecari tajacu) populations in Texas have shown
considerable variation since the 1940s because of urban development and land-use change,
among other habitat reductions. Historically, peccaries were distributed throughout central,
southern, and western Texas, but current populations occur in the southwestern third of Texas.
Despite their relatively widespread distribution and importance as a game animal, prey item,
and seed disperser, little scholarly work has been done on the species in the state. Therefore,
we seek to identify biotic and abiotic factors that impact peccary distribution across two
ecoregions using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution models (SDM) and presence-
only occurrences from iNaturalist. In Texas, peccary habitat can be described generally as
shrub-dominated semi-arid desert, so we will include these vegetation characteristics into the
SDM, along with herbaceous vegetation,  anthropogenic features (e.g., roads, development),
and agricultural lands. We will develop one SDM per ecoregion (i.e., South Texas Plains and
Trans-Pecos) and then assess the transferability of ecoregion-specific models to predict
distribution in the other ecoregions; this will allow us to assess habitat generality versus
specificity. To date, using data from iNaturalist, we will model 701 observations for the South
Texas Plains and 760 detections for the Trans-Pecos. These results will provide managers with
spatially explicit tools and distribution maps to restore, manage, and protect peccary habitat.
These data can also assist with setting ecoregion-specific season and bag limits, considering
peccary are classified as a game species in Texas.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3,2024,NA
52,Morphometrics can be used to estimate body mass and age in wild pigs,"Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species that cause ≥1.5 billion dollars in
damage annually. In response to these damages, population control efforts such as eradication
are often employed. Population control is necessary to reduce the rapid population growth of the
species, which is driven by large litter sizes, high survival, short interbirth intervals, and
reproductive maturity at a young age. Demographic information facilitates modeling population
size and growth, so morphometrics that can assign an individual to an age class can increase
the precision of population models. To investigate which morphometric characters are reliable
predicters of body mass and age, we captured wild pigs across 6 study sites in southern
Oklahoma. After capture, wild pigs were euthanized, and collected body mass, age, and four
morphometric characters: shoulder height, total body length, and chest and stomach
circumference. We built separate linear regression models for each morphometric measurement
to predict body mass and employed machine learning classifiers (linear discriminant analysis,
discriminant analysis of principal components, and naïve Bayes classifier) to assign wild pigs
into 2, 4, 5, or 6 age groupings using the four morphometrics measurements combined or
individually. Regardless of sex, all four morphometric measurements were highly correlated with
body mass (r² ≥ 0.921); however, chest circumference was the most correlated with body mass
(r² = 0.976). Currently, age class assignments have only been run using linear discriminant
analysis with the shoulder height morphometric and model accuracy was (≥82.6%) for a two age
class model, reproductive and non-reproductive.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3,2024,NA
53,Economic Value of White-tailed Deer in Texas,"Texas ranks among the highest in annual hunters and days spent hunting, and white-
tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are the most sought-after game species in the state. White-
tailed deer hunting is an important contributor to the state’s economy; however, an updated
economic estimate is currently unknown. Our goal was to estimate the economic value of white-
tailed deer in Texas. We conducted a web-based survey of 100,000 Texas hunting license
holders for the 2022–2023 hunting season. Our survey included a filter question directing
participants to either a hunter-focused questionnaire or a landowner-focused questionnaire
assessing hunter expenditures and landowner expenditures and income related to white-tailed
deer. We analyzed survey responses and extrapolated the total reported annual expense to
estimate the statewide impact. We had a 9% response rate, with a total of 9,079 respondents.
Of those, 6,275 were hunters, and 2,804 were landowners. Average expenditures were $3,348
and $18,812 for hunters and landowners, respectively. The largest annual expenditures were
outfitter fees for hunters (average >$1,000) and payroll for landowners (average >$2,900).
Hunters spent an average of $2,904 annually on lease fees. The most common landowner
expenditure was supplemental feed, averaging $3,593 annually. Once extrapolated to include
the nearly 555,000 white-tailed deer hunters and 199,000 white-tailed deer-related landowners
in Texas, total expenditures were $1.9 billion and $2.5 billion for hunters and landowners,
respectively. Total annual expenditures related to white-tailed deer in Texas are estimated to be
$4.3 billion. Understanding the economic value of white-tailed deer in Texas is important when
making management decisions.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 3,2024,NA
54,Relative Efficacy of a Novel GPS Tracking Technology for Monitoring African Lion Movement Behavior.,"Solar-powered GPS ear tags represent a novel, cost-effective technology that could
revolutionize large carnivore research and conservation efforts by enabling large-scale analyses
currently precluded by the prohibitive cost of GPS collar technology. These devices may be
particularly useful for monitoring subadult, male carnivores, a demographic often excluded from
tracking research because the industry standard – GPS collars (hereafter, collars) – present a
strangulation hazard during the animal’s growth. While solar-powered GPS ear tags (hereafter,
ear tags) have been used to effectively monitor wild ungulates, to our knowledge, they have
never been systematically deployed on large carnivores. Our objectives were to 1) compare the
relative performance and suitability of a 35 g solar-powered GPS ear tag versus the industry
standard – a GPS collar – for field application on lions (Panthera leo), and 2) compare the effect
of battery management algorithm on ear tag performance. To evaluate the relative
performances of ear tags versus collars, we deployed devices on lions, each fitted with one (1)
ear tag and one (1) collar simultaneously. To assess the effect of battery management algorithm
on ear tag performance, we deployed pairs of ear tags – differing only in battery management
software – on free-ranging cattle. For all analyses, we measured successful fix acquisition rate
(SFR), accuracy, precision and consistency over time as indicators of technological
performance. Our results provide an in-situ comparison of GPS tracking technology, providing
insight into the efficacy of ear tags as an alternative to collars for monitoring lions.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4,2024,NA
55,Assessing the occurrence of large carnivores on pastoral landscapes of the,"Agricultural development is one of the major global threats to wildlife in unprotected
areas. In western Botswana, the Western Kalahari Corridor (WCC) is a 200-km unprotected gap
between the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (38,000 km2) and the Central Kalahari/Khutse game
reserves (55,300 km2) and provides critical connectivity between the parks. Although
designated as a “wildlife management area,” in recent decades the corridor has seen a
significant increase in livestock farming and associated development. To understand the impact
of human development on large carnivores, we conducted a camera trap study in the WCC. Our
site was an unprotected and mostly unfenced area of approximately 3,500 km2 centered on the
villages of Bere and Kacgae.  The sparsely populated area is bisected by a single paved
highway and dominated by pastoral farming.  Thirty-two boreholes are scatted around the area
and provide water to remote cattle posts. We placed 120 camera traps, 60 along roads each
paired with a second trap 500-m away from the road.  Each consisted of a single motion-
triggered infrared camera. We checked traps monthly during February – November 2023. We
identified 29 mammal species, including lion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus), cheetah
(Acinonyx jubatus), wild dog (Lycaon pictus), and brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea). We are
using occupancy modelling to identify associations with anthropogenic features including roads,
villages, cattle posts, and livestock activities. Our results will inform wildlife managers and
conservation as to whether the presence of livestock farming in the area impacts the occurrence
of large carnivores in this critical corridor.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4,2024,NA
56,"If you like the leopards, take them all to America: Social drivers affecting human- leopard coexistence in Nepal's mid-hill region","Human-leopard conflict has increased in Nepal's mid-hill region, with leopard-induced
mortality accounting for twenty percent of all wildlife-related fatalities. This growing conflict
generates negative attitudes towards the Common Leopard (Panthera pardus), threatening
effective human-leopard coexistence and the species' survival. Our study investigates local
attitudes toward the Common Leopard and its conservation in the community forests of Nepal's
mid-hill region. We conducted 123 household surveys, collecting data regarding demographics,
socioeconomic factors, general attitudes toward leopard conservation, and human-leopard
conflict incidents. Results reveal socioeconomic status, education, and income significantly
impact local perceptions. Higher socioeconomic status and education levels associate with
positive attitudes, while lower-income individuals often view leopards as threatening to their
safety and livelihoods. Despite prevalent retaliatory killings and negative perceptions, few
respondents received education regarding leopards and their conservation. Additionally, though
ecotourism is lucrative in other areas of Nepal, few respondents felt they could benefit
economically from wildlife. Our study stresses community engagement's importance in
conservation. Addressing social factors influencing attitudes is crucial for successful long-term
conservation. Our results suggest education initiatives, community involvement, and ensuring
economic benefits from wildlife could shift perceptions. Ultimately, aligning conservation
strategies with community interests is critical to successful and sustainable leopard
conservation. Our research provides a roadmap for future projects, highlighting the need for
strategies considering the socioeconomic realities of communities living alongside leopards.
Understanding and addressing local needs and concerns can help foster positive perceptions of
leopards, ensuring sustainable human-leopard coexistence in Nepal's mid-hills and conserving
these incredible felids for future generations.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4,2024,NA
57,Activity Patterns of Ungulates and Their Associated Predators Within Niokolo Koba,"Alteration of spatiotemporal diel activity patterns is a common strategy employed by
prey species to minimize predation risk, allowing them to exploit high-quality resources while
avoiding encounters with predators.  However, there are still ecological systems in which these
patterns remain largely unexplored. Our objective was to assess the diel activity patterns of
ungulates and their associated predators at Niokolo Koba National Park. In 2013, we conducted
a single-season camera survey at two study sites within the park: Linguekountou (04 February
to 23 April) and Niokolo (30 April to 07 July). We deployed paired cameras for 2,014 trap nights
in Linguekountou and 1,707 trap nights in Niokolo and collected vegetation metrics at 30
locations per site. We used the Kernel Density Estimator to analyze the coefficient of activity
overlap ( d̂) across both sites to assess how predation risk affects the diel activity of ungulates.
Results suggest that ungulates share a moderate temporal activity overlap ( d̂ = 0.43) with their
associated predators, with Bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) indicating the highest temporal
activity overlap ( d̂= 0.61; n = 425), and Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) indicating the
lowest temporal activity overlap ( d̂ = 0.27; n = 813) among associated predators. These data

58,"Small Mammal Community Characteristics and Habitat Use Along an Herbivory Gradient in the Central Kalahari Desert, Botswana","The Kalahari Desert of southern Africa contains one of the largest contiguous
conservation landscapes in the world. Historically, the region was largely undeveloped and
sparsely populated.  However, in recent decades, agricultural development and encroachment
by human communities and livestock have significantly impacted this system.  By developing
artificial water points for livestock grazing, humans have altered the presence and behavior of
both domestic and native herbivores, resulting in patterns of herbivory different than those under
which the system evolved.  This may have altered vegetation communities, potentially affecting
biodiversity.   We sampled small mammal and plant communities at 10 sites near the villages of
Bere and Kacgae, Botswana. Sites were situated along an herbivory gradient between <1 km
and >4 km from the nearest artificial water point.  We sampled 160 trap-nights per site for a total
of 1,600 trap-nights.  We captured and marked 60 individual small mammals representing 8
species.  The most common small-mammal species encountered were Namaqua rock rat
(Aethomys [=Micaelamys] namaquensis, n = 15) and bushveld elephant-shrew (Elephantulus
intufi, n = 15). We also captured hairy-footed gerbil (Gerbilliscus paeba, n = 8), bushveld gerbil
(Gerbilliscus leucogaster, n = 7), single-striped grass-mouse (Lemniscomys rosalia, n = 7),
multimammate mouse (Mastomys sp., n = 5), fat mouse (Streatomys krebsii, n = 2), and

hibernating bat species, such as the tri-colored bat (Perimyotis subflavus). An important over-
wintering population of ~3000 tri-colored bats roosts in culverts in East Texas, where WNS has
remained absent despite Pseudogymnoascus destructans (the causative fungus of WNS) being
present in Texas since 2017. Over the course of this project, we examined the logistical

60,Snake Captures Decline as a Function of Trap Age: Implications for Monitoring Programs,"Demographic and diversity studies rely on sampling techniques that produce
representative samples from populations and communities. Snakes, with their cryptic behaviors
and prolonged periods of inactivity, make population and community assessments particularly
challenging. In terrestrial ecosystems, box traps paired with drift fences have been used widely
to survey for large-bodied snakes. However, there has been anecdotal evidence that suggests
snakes become trap shy over time, reducing capture rates. Utilizing a long-term trapping
dataset of snake captures throughout forests in east Texas and western Louisiana, we sought to
determine if snake capture rate declined as a function of trap age (i.e., time it was installed on
the landscape). Total snake captures declined across all traps (n = 43) across time when
comparing the first year of trapping to subsequent years. These results suggest that to
maximize capture success, long-term monitoring programs should attempt to move box traps to

62,Texas Tortoise Movement Patterns Following Three Soft Release Periods After Translocation,"Texas tortoises (Gopherus berlandieri) are a state threatened species in Texas that
has experienced sharp declines in population number, and their distribution has become
sporadic.  Southern Texas lomas, grasslands, and brushlands are the habitat where tortoises
can be found; however, urban-suburbanization and commercial development are reducing
available habitat for tortoises.  Translocation often is suggested as a mitigation option; however,
we are unaware of any research that investigated the effects of translocation on Texas tortoises
to verify that translocation is a responsible management option.  Therefore, we translocated 222
Texas tortoises from a property under development in extreme southern Texas and placed them
in equal numbers within 3, 2.4 ha enclosures near Kingsville, Texas.  Approximately 26
tortoises/enclosure were outfitted with GPS transmitters to follow their movements.  Tortoises
were maintained in enclosures for 4, 8, and 12 months as a soft release measure, after which,
enclosure walls were removed and tortoises had free-choice to leave the area.  Tortoises did
not display directional movement or attempt to home, but randomly moved in all directions after
each time period.  No differences in movement patterns or distances were observed between
male and female tortoises.  On average, tortoises moved ~25m/day.  Mortality rates between
soft release periods of translocated tortoises and between translocated tortoises and resident
tortoises were similar.  Therefore, translocation does not appear to have an immediate negative
impact on Texas tortoises.  Also, a soft release period of 4 months that incorporates one
brumation appears sufficient to halt the homing tendency of Texas tortoises.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4,2024,NA
63,Demography of Alligator Snapping Turtles (Macrochelys temminckii) Along a Fishing Pressure Gradient,"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is a state threatened species
in Texas and a candidate for being listed as federally threatened. However, there is a lack of
information on the demography of M. temminckii in the western portion of its range. Passive
fishing gear (e.g., trotlines, limblines, juglines) has been identified as a threat to M. temminckii,
but its impact on populations has yet to be quantified. We estimated the demographic
parameters of M. temminckii in habitats of varying intensities of passive fishing pressure, while
also quantifying the extent and persistence of passive fishing gear in aquatic habitats. From
June – December 2023, we surveyed for M. temminckii and conducted passive fishing gear
surveys at three study sites in east Texas: Alazan Bayou WMA (unfished), the Attoyac River

fished and unfished study sites. Furthermore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) of M. temminckii was
lower at both fished sites (i.e., Attoyac and Shawnee) compared to the unfished site (i.e.,
Alazan). Passive fishing gear was abundant at the Attoyac and Shawnee study sites, however,

65,Comparing the survival of repatriated and wild alligator snapping turtles in eastern Texas,"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is the largest freshwater turtle
in North America. As such, M. temminckii are sought after for human consumption and are
vulnerable to overharvest or bycatch. Despite having protection from harvest in Texas since the
1980s, M. temminckii are still harvested illegally for food and novelty products. Given their life
history, such threats may exacerbate declines in local populations. Therefore, efforts that can
bolster wild populations are of importance to M. temminckii conservation. In June 2021, 8 M.
temminckii confiscated by federal agents were released at the Angelina/Neches Dam B WMA.
Using survival as a metric to evaluate repatriation efforts, we monitored these previously
released repatriated turtles alongside 10 wild turtles. We estimated survival probabilities using
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to account for inconsistencies in radiotelemetry data, and to
assess how certain covariates (e.g., home range, movement, habitat use, etc.) may impact
survival. Overall, repatriated M. temminckii had significantly lower survival than wild M.
temmincki. Movement distance between relocations and time of year had a significant influence
on repatriated turtle survival. Some reductions in survival probability were likely linked to sex-
specific differences in behavior; however, wild M. temminckii had high survival regardless of
sex. These results highlight how long-term studies are often difficult, but neccessary to assess
survival in long-lived species. Understanding factors that influence M. temminckii survival can
inform future conservation efforts, and are especially valuable to translocation efforts attempting
to bolster wild populations.

population strongholds remain, spread patchily across the species range and encompassing
multiple different ecoregions and habitat types. To successfully arrest the decline of Northern
Bobwhite, identifying areas where quail are succeeding, where they are in decline, and what
factors are driving quail population dynamics across their range is critical. Furthermore, it is
important to conduct these analyses across a large spatiotemporal scale to account for annual
stochasticity in environmental conditions and structural variation in quail habitat. Although local
quail covey count data is typically a more accurate index of quail abundance, there is significant
variation in data collection methodology among state agencies, which makes comparing these
estimates across time and large geographic areas difficult. Because North American Breeding

68,Fat Bobwhites: Does Supplemental Feed Maintain Northern Bobwhite Mass Over Winter?,"Research has indicated that northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) with heavier
mass and higher body fat composition are associated with reduced physiological stress and a
greater likelihood of surviving severe weather. Mass and percent body fat have also been found
to decrease from late fall to early spring.  To alleviate those trends, managers often provide
supplemental feed throughout the winter, but the effects are relatively unknown.  This study
aims to determine if providing supplemental feed aids in maintaining body mass of bobwhites
through the winter period.  The project is taking place on the East Foundation property in Jim
Hogg County, with two designated sites consisting of a 2,111-ha fed site and a 6,118-ha unfed
site, both under the same harvest rate (20% of fall population).   Grain sorghum is distributed

measurements from 841 hunter-harvested bobwhites (342=fed site, 499=unfed).  We randomly
selected 100 bobwhites from each study site, only including those who were either adults or
over 150 days old.  We found no significant difference between body mass from the fed or unfed
sites (t=1.11, df=192.6, P=0.268), with mean body masses of 149.3 ± 1.0 SE grams and 150.0 ±

69,Evolution and Outcomes of American Oystercatcher Monitoring Along the Upper Texas Coast,"Across many coastal environments, there is an ever-present threat to waterbirds
consisting of changes in both quantity and quality of breeding and foraging habitat. One such
species, the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), is a species of high concern for
the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan and is a Texas Wildlife Action Plan priority species.
Because this species faces serious threats due to its restriction to coastal areas, suspected
increase in nest predators, potential contamination of food resources, and habitat alterations
through erosion, storm systems, and human modification, Gulf Coast Bird Observatory initiated
a long-term study in 2011 to monitor annual productivity and document locations in need of
restoration and habitat management. Since 2011, oystercatcher annual nesting success has
ranged from 14–81%, with an average of 51%. Monitoring efforts have evolved as more birds
were color banded, allowing for yearly resights and specific pair information. This has led to an
understanding of pair behavior and movements, recruitment, and breeding territory analysis.
Through this project, GCBO has gained insight into the determinants of nesting success and
failure, including environmental variables, disturbance factors, and territory quality. With the
decrease in oyster shell island size and elevation due to erosion, it is suspected that the number
of nesting pairs has decreased as a direct response to these changes. Accordingly, these
observations have led to increased recognition of the plight of American Oystercatchers, with
multiagency collaboration and partnerships committed to continued monitoring efforts, public
education and outreach, and the conservation of this at-risk species.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4,2024,NA
70,Cowbird trapping permitting review,"Cowbird trapping is used to help recover endangered black-capped vireos (BCVI).
The BCVI was listed in 1987 and recovered in 2018 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS). The USFWS encourages continued trapping during the post-delisting monitoring
period, 2019-2030. There is no federal regulatory provision that extends trapping beyond a
delisting. Managers at Fort Cavazos must either 1) attain a cowbird federal depredation permit,
or 2) use the terms and conditions in the current Cowbird Depredation Order. If Texas trappers
trap under the Cowbird Depredation Order for BCVI, they must monitor two lists; including the
Texas Species of Greatest Conservation Concern, and/or the U.S. Birds of Conservation
Concern and ensure the BCVI is listed in atleast one of two of those lists. Trappers who failure
to trap under the authority of a current cowbird depredation permit, or under the terms outlined
in the current Cowbird Depredation Order will be in violation of federal law. I will discuss details
of trapping under these two means in more detail as it pertains to Fort Cavazos continued post-
recovery efforts..",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Mammals 4,2024,NA
71,Variation in Microplastic Contamination Across Development and Within Brood of Nestling House Sparrows,"Microplastic pollution is an emerging threat to environmental and human health, with
concomitant impacts to wildlife, including many species of birds. However, the majority of avian
studies have been conducted on seabirds. Despite passerines comprising more than half of all
bird species, little is known about how microplastic pollutants impact passerine health. We
initiated a pilot study to better understand the abundance of microplastic pollution in songbirds
in summer 2023, utilizing house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings as our model taxa
through a non-lethal method of microplastic detection (i.e., collection of fecal sacs). House
sparrows, being a widespread and human-commensalist species, are ideal bioindicators for
microplastic pollution. Our objectives were to determine how microplastic abundance varied
across nestling development and among nestlings within a nest. We collected fecal sacs from
nestlings at established house sparrow nest colonies in Stephenville, TX, Fargo, ND, Easton,
PA, and Lexington, KY. After collection, we subjected samples to chemical digestion using 30%
H2O2, vacuum filtration, and examination under a stereomicroscope. We compared microplastic
contamination using two metrics: density (number of microplastics/gram fecal matter) and length
(mm/gram fecal matter). We detected microplastic contaminants in 83.6% of samples for our
Texas colonies (n = 128) and 63.5% of samples for our Pennsylvania colonies (n = 74).
Preliminary results suggest no difference in microplastic abundance between young (day 2) and
old (day 10) nestlings. By conducting this study on house sparrows, we can obtain broader
insight into the prevalence of microplastic pollution within passerine species.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 4,2024,NA
72,Parental Attentiveness in House Sparrows Across a Latitudinal Temperature Gradient,"Ambient temperatures are changing across the globe and generating a broad range
of behavioral responses in many species, including birds. Behavior is one of the first
adjustments that organisms can make to cope with stressful environmental conditions.
Temperature variation can cause birds to force trade-offs with other behaviors at the expense of
thermoregulation. One way to examine potential responses to temperature change is to
evaluate behaviors across temperature gradients. Our study examines parental incubation
behaviors in free-living House sparrows (Passer domesticus) across a latitudinal and
temperature gradient from Texas and North Dakota populations. We hypothesized that ambient
temperature is associated with variation in parental incubation on-bouts and nest material
delivery rates, and that these behaviors are longer when temperatures are extreme. From May–
July 2022 and 2023, we recorded parental attentiveness on incubation days 5, 6, or 7 using
video cameras at nest boxes for 4 hours in the morning. Results found no support for our
hypothesis across the season in 2022 and 2023. However, in 2022, female on-bouts were
longer in North Dakota (n = 26, mean = 34.6 min/hr, 95% CI = 31.6–37.7 min/hr) than in Texas
(n = 27, mean = 24.6 min/hr, 95% CI = 20.7–28.5 min/hr; F 3,132 = 17.81, p ≤ 0.001). This
study will increase our understanding of how temperature influences parental attentiveness in
passerines, with implications for how birds could respond to climate change.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 4,2024,NA
73,Parental provisioning in house sparrows does not vary across temperature gradients,"The mechanisms behind Bergmann’s rule are poorly understood, but one possibility
is parental behavioral differences across temperature gradients influence body size. In birds,
food delivery rates can influence altricial young growth rates resulting in body mass differences
at fledging. Environmental variables associated with temperature could alter feeding rates. Our
study evaluated house sparrow (Passer domesticus) feeding rates across temperature and
latitudinal gradients from Texas to North Dakota. We hypothesized that ambient temperature
would influence parental feeding rates and nestling body size. If hot temperatures reduce food
availability and increase metabolic demands of adults, then feeding rates should decrease
resulting in smaller nestling body sizes. We predicted this relationship to be stronger in the
southern sites. We provided nest boxes for house sparrows across our study sites. On day 5, 6,
or 7 post-hatching, we recorded parental feeding using video cameras placed approximately 2
m from nest boxes for 4 hours in the morning (between 0630-1130 hrs). We collected
morphological measurements of nestlings on days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 post-hatch. Results
showed that nestlings are larger in North Dakota than in Texas on day 10 post-hatch (F3,1302 =
62.88, P < 0.001). However, there is no difference in feeding rates between North Dakota and
Texas ( F1,175 = 2.89, P = 0.091). This study will increase our understanding of how parental
feeding rates are associated with differences in body size and temperature, with implications for
how birds might respond",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 4,2024,NA
74,Exposure of terrestrial birds to microplastic: The effects of ecological traits,"Microplastics (<5mm) have been found extensively in marine organisms, including
seabirds, and have been found to have deleterious effects on birds. However, little is known
about the potential exposure of terrestrial birds to microplastics despite plastic pollution being
pervasive in terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, whether bird species are differently exposed
based on ecological traits is largely unknown. This study aims to (1) investigate the exposure of
terrestrial birds to microplastics by examining gastrointestinal contents and (2) explore potential
relationships between microplastic exposure, diet type, and foraging strategies. Birds were
opportunistically collected during window strike surveys in Texas, and nine species were
selected to represent a broad range of distinct diet types and foraging strategies. The bird
species selected were Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla
cedrorum), Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), House Wren (Troglodytes aedon),
Nashville Warbler (Leiothlypis ruficapilla), Purple Martin (Progne subis), Ruby-throated
Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris), White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis), and
Great-tailed Grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus). The esophagus through the intestines were
carefully removed from bird carcasses (n=108) and digested in a 10% potassium hydroxide
solution. The resulting solution was filtered, and microplastics were individually extracted,
characterized, and counted under a stereomicroscope. To ensure accurate identification,
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to verify polymer type. Results
suggest that most birds assessed were exposed to microplastics, with ground-feeding birds that
have omnivorous and granivorous diets consuming the greatest quantities of microplastics. This
research contributes valuable insights into the underexplored realm of microplastic in terrestrial
avian populations.",oral,Conservation and Ecology of Birds 4,2024,NA
75,"Impact of Livestock Guardian Dogs, Small Livestock, and Anthropogenic Features on Mesopredator Abundance in the Kalahari Desert","Livestock depredation is a major cause of human-wildlife conflict in African pastoral
communities. These communities practice traditional farming systems in which livestock (e.g.,
cattle, horse, sheep, and goat) roam freely at a centralized grazing location with a drilled
borehole for water needs. Studies have shown black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and
caracal (Caracal caracal) frequently predate on small livestock (sheep and goat) in grazing
areas. As a result, farmers use livestock guardian dogs (Canis lupus familiaris; LGD) to deter
mesopredators from livestock. In this study, our primary objective is to understand the effects of
LGDs and small livestock on mesopredator abundance in relation to anthropogenic features in
the Kalahari landscape of Botswana. We will examine how small livestock herds with and
without LGDs influence targeted (jackal and caracal) and non-targeted mesopredators. Our
study site is in the Ghanzi District (GH10 and GH11) at the villages of Bere and Kacgae. We
deployed a network of 120 game cameras across the study site from January to December
2023; 60 camera traps were placed on sand or gravel roads and were paired with a second
camera approximately 500 m perpendicular to the road into the bush. Cameras were checked
once a month, and images were processed using TimeLapse. We will conduct future analyses
in spring 2024 to examine mesopredator diversity and richness at roads, cattle posts, and
villages. The findings of this study will provide insight into how mesopredator populations are
impacted by livestock settlements for future conservation planning.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
76,Prey Selection and Diet Composition of Mountain Lions (Puma concolor) in South Texas,"Limited knowledge exists regarding the prey selection and diet composition of
mountain lions (Puma concolor) in South Texas. In the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, mountain
lions have been documented to prey on large game animals such as deer (Odocoileus spp.),
javelina (Pecari tajacu), feral hog (Sus scrofa), and domestic livestock, such as cattle (Bos
spp.). Due to the importance of white-tailed deer to the Texas hunting economy, we are
interested in (1) whether white-tailed deer represent a disproportionate amount of mountain lion
diet in South Texas compared to other prey species, and (2) the age and sex of white-tailed
deer that are killed by mountain lions. Our primary study sites will be the Comanche and Faith
Ranches outside of Eagle Pass. We will investigate these questions using (1) GPS collar data
and investigations of kill sites, and (2) genetic analysis of scat samples. Our results will guide
decisions regarding the potential management challenges posed by mountain lions on private
lands.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
77,Variations in waterfowl species composition and habitat selection in two ecoregions in north-central Texas,"North American waterfowl have been a popular game species for centuries and have
considerable support for conservation over many game species. Even with these conservation
efforts, waterfowl numbers are still on a decline and population monitoring is necessary. Our
objective is to examine seasonal habitat use and activity of waterfowl at two locations in north
central Texas, where little information is known about waterfowl in the area: Tarleton State
University’s Timberlake Biological Field Station and Palo Pinto Mountains State Park, set to
open to the public in late 2024. These sites are in two different ecoregions, managed for wildlife,
and do not allow waterfowl hunting. From November 2022 to April 2023 at the State Park, we
conducted field surveys at water sources every two weeks. During surveys, we documented
numbers, species, sex, behavior, and arrival and departure time. We are continuing these
surveys at both study areas from November 2023 to April 2024. We placed game cameras at
water sources at both study areas in April 2023 and will monitor cameras for at least one year.
From November 2022 to March 2023, we observed 6 species, primarily ringneck (Aythya
collaris) and American wigeon (Mareca americana) at the state park. From April 2023 to
November 2023, we observed wood ducks (Aix sponsa) and blue-winged teal (Spatula discors)
at both study sites. Our ongoing study will improve our understanding of the migration activity of
waterfowl, different uses of water sources, and variations in species composition between the
ecoregions.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
78,Influence of Weather and Urbanization on Coyote Activity across the U.S.,"One of the major causes of species extinction is urbanization. In fact, urbanization
endangers more species and affects more land space in the United States than any other
human activity. However, climate change is causing unprecedented changes to weather, which
also affects wildlife. Recent research on urban mesopredators suggests a consistent trend
toward declining species richness with increasing urban intensity. However, not all research
areas or species exhibit these patterns. One of these mesopredators, the coyote (Canis latrans)
is an opportunistic carnivore that has adapted to the spread of urbanization and are now present
in large metropolitan areas. In this study, we used camera trap data from Snapshot, a multi-
institutional collaboration, collected from 2019 - 2020 to perform a comparison between weather
and urbanization to compare effects on coyote activity across the United States. We
hypothesized that urbanization would have a greater impact on coyote activity. We used a linear
regression model with count of coyotes as the response variable and a suite of weather and
urbanization covariates as continuous predictor variables. Our results suggest that the mean
road density (p= 0.02160), cultivated lands (p= 0.00869), and GPP (gross primary productivity)
(p= 0.0369) had the greatest negative effect on coyote activity. We suggest further research on
coyote activity in metropolitan areas because even though coyotes can adapt to urbanization,
there are some urbanized components that have a negative effect on coyote activity.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
79,A Gut Content Composition Analysis of Four Native Fishes of the Red River.,"River regulation and degraded riparian habitat can diminish resource heterogeneity
that supports riverine food-webs of prairie fishes. Yet, the ecology of many prairie stream fishes
is not well understood including baseline knowledge about spatial and temporal variation in diet
habits as the availability and quality of aquatic and terrestrial food sources change. Here, we
characterize the diets of four species of greatest conservation need, in the Red River: Red River
Pupfish (Cyprinodon rubrofluviatilis), Plains Minnow (Hybognathus placitus), Prairie
Chub (Macrhybopsis australis), and Red River Shiner (Notropis bairdi). We attempted to collect
ten of each species at each site for our six sites across the Red River from spring, summer and
fall of 2023. Gut contents were extracted using a luer syringe, homogenized in 10 mL of DI
water, and dried onto a gridded filter for characterization of diets. We subsampled 20% of the
filter unless the coverage of diet items occupied less than 50% of the filter. We divided diet
contents into 10 categories to represent aquatic and terrestrial primary producers,
macroinvertebrates, vertebrates, and other miscellaneous items. Feeding strategies and relative
diet specialization were evaluated based on the relationship between prey-specific abundance
and the frequency of occurrence of diet items. For example, Plains Minnow diets were
comprised of high abundance and occurrence of diatoms indicating a more dominant reliance
on aquatic primary production compared to other species. Feeding habits from this analysis will
be a baseline to inform the conservation of these species in the face of environmental change.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
80,Movements of Feral Cats on the Campus of Abilene Christian University,"Abilene Christian University (ACU) has transformed its perspective on feral cats
(Felis catus), viewing them not as nuisances but as assets in managing pests on campus.
Through implementation of a Trap-Neuter-Release (TNR) program, ACU has neutered 120 cats
since 2014. However, there remains a need for further research to understand feral cat behavior
and interactions for effective management. This study aimed to enhance our understanding of
movement patterns of feral cats on the ACU campus, explore interactions between different
sub-populations, and provide preliminary data for future comprehensive studies. The study,
conducted in the spring of 2023, employed radio telemetry and GPS tracking to collect data on
feral cat behavior. Collars with radio transmitters (less than 5% of body weight) were fitted to 6
cats.  An Apple AirTag (Bluetooth technology) was attached to another cat. Data collection
involved tracking the cats during four six hour time blocks during 4 8-day periods between
February 11, 2023 and April 16, 2023.  Of the 4 cats tracked the length of the study, 2 were
abandoned domesticated cats, while 2 were born feral. The domesticated cats exhibited
different behavior compared to feral cats . Feral cats had larger home ranges, avoiding human
interaction, while domesticated cats had smaller home ranges near feeding sites and high-traffic
areas. Sub-colonies showed no distinct grouping based on feeding sites. Spatial behavior was
influenced by human interaction, feeding sites, and weather conditions. The study identified
potential ecological impacts, such as competition for resources and increased spread of health
issues.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
81,The Northern Bobwhite Decline in Texas: is Habitat Loss Truly to Blame?,"Habitat loss is considered an ultimate cause of the northern bobwhite (Colinus
virginianus) decline. Even within population strongholds of northern and southern Texas, the
species appears declining and habitat loss is considered the cause. Our objective was to
evaluate the habitat-loss hypothesis by quantifying the long-term trend (1938‒2023) in bobwhite
habitat in northern and southern Texas. We used historical (1938–1992) and projected (1992–
2023) land cover datasets to quantify changes in 2 cover classes associated with habitat loss
(urban and cropland). We also quantified the amount of bobwhite habitat by reclassifying cover
classes into habitat or not habitat. Percent urban approximately doubled (from ≈0.5% to 1.0%)
during 1938–2023 but remained a small percent of the landscape (<2%) in both regions.
Percent cropland also remained stable in northern (18.7‒27.0%) and southern (12.2‒13.1%)
Texas. Moreover, the amount of bobwhite habitat was high and stable in both regions (60–
70%). Thus, we did not find evidence for the habitat-loss hypothesis and hypothesize that other
factors (e.g., a prolonged dry cycle) may be responsible for the bobwhite decline in Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
82,Trends in raptor admissions to wildlife rehabilitation centers across 13 years in the southern High plains of Texas,"As urbanization increases, human and wildlife interaction and conflicts are becoming
more frequent. Wildlife rehabilitation centers have become important resources for a public that
has become increasingly concerned for the well fare of injured wildlife. However, details on
admission rates and outcomes are often lacking. We examined 13 years of admission data for
birds of prey submitted to the South Plains Wildlife Rehabilitation Center and Night Wings
Rehabilitation Center, both located in Lubbock Texas. The raptors submitted were categorized
by reason for admission: 1) collision, 2) illness, and 3) other. Submissions were also
categorized by age: 1) independent (adults and juveniles after their first winter), 2) juveniles in
their first winter, and 3) dependent juveniles (e.g., nestlings and fledglings). Owls however were
categorized only as independent and or dependent juveniles. We recorded 3,231 individuals of
28 raptor species (2 Cathartiformes, 15 Accipitriformes, 4 Falconiformes, and 7 Strigiformes)
admitted during the study period at an average of 248.6 admissions per year.  Seven species
each accounted for ≥ 5% of admissions. Adult and older juveniles accounted for 53%, first
winter juveniles accounting for 14.4%, and nestling and fledglings accounting for 32.5% of
admissions. Collisions accounted for 50% of admissions, various illnesses accounted for 10%,
and rescue/kidnapping of nestlings accounted for 26% of admissions. Among collisions injuries,
the most common presentation was broken wings (51%). Our data indicate raptors are a
commonly admitted taxonomic group, possibly due to their easy recognition and appreciation by
members of the public.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
83,Interactions Between Collared Peccaries and Feral Hogs on a Southern Gulf Coast Rangeland,"Invasive species can negatively impact native species through negative species
interactions and competition for resources.  For example, native collared peccaries (Peccari
tajacu; peccaries) utilize similar habitats and forage as invasive feral hogs (Sus scrofa), which
researchers have speculated is the cause of declines in peccary populations over the last 60
years. In addition, peccaries are known to alter their activity patterns when feral hogs are
present. Our goal was to evaluate potential interactions between peccaries and feral hogs to
better understand the effects of this invasive species on peccaries.  We established 24 remote
camera stations spaced approximately 1 km apart on the Welder Wildlife Refuge in San Patricio
County, Texas. We compared hourly peccary activity at sites with and without feral hog
presence from July 2021 to October 2021. Overall, peccaries exhibited a crepuscular activity
pattern when feral hogs were not present; however, their activity covered a wider range of
activity times in the presence of feral hogs. Specifically, we observed more peccaries in the
early morning, midday, and later in the nighttime at sites with a feral hog presence, suggestive
of avoidance behavior. Species interactions are an important parameter to consider in wildlife
management, especially when invasive species alter the behavior and conservation of native
wildlife populations.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
84,An Assessment of the Impact of Aoudad on Palatable Shrubs at the Fort Davis,"Herbivores strongly influence plant communities by changing vegetation composition,
diversity, and productivity. Moderate browsing has been shown to stimulate growth of lateral
buds along stems, thus increasing forage availability. Over-browsing, however, reduces foliar
cover, affecting the plant’s ability to capture sunlight, photosynthesize, and reproduce. The rapid
population growth and dispersal of aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) following their introduction in
Texas during the 1950s has caused concern about the impact that overabundant exotic
populations may have on native vegetation. This highlights the need to understand how aoudad
are utilizing vegetation and how this resource use impacts the landscape. The Fort Davis
National Historic Site is absent of livestock grazing and a large population of aoudad frequents
the area. These factors make it a suitable site to evaluate plant response to aoudad browsing
pressure. To do so, we selected five species of palatable shrubs: fragrant sumac (Rhus
aromatica), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), littleleaf
leadtree (Leucaena retusa), and gray oak (Quercus grisea). Four individuals from each species
were chosen and monitored using remote cameras to determine ungulate species visitation
frequency and abundance. We built exclosures around two individuals of each species during
July 2023. In October 2023, near the end of the growing season, we measured unlignified
growth on both unexclosed and exclosed plants. Surveys will be repeated in 2024. Results from
the two sets of plants will be compared to quantify the growth difference in plants that
experience browsing pressure from aoudad and those that do not.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
85,How You Measure Matters: Understanding the Scale at Which Bobwhites Respond to Habitat and Rainfall,"Although the positive influence of habitat and rainfall on northern bobwhite (Colinus
virginianus) is well documented, what is unknown is the scale at which populations respond to
these factors. Our objective was to determine the influence of scale on habitat- and rainfall-quail
relationships in northern and southern Texas. We used roadside survey data from Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department to estimate bobwhite relative abundance in northern (n = 71 routes)
and southern (n = 36 routes) Texas. We then used 2019 National Land Cover Data and
CropScape imagery to quantify bobwhite habitat and PRISM to obtain annual rainfall. We
buffered survey routes to various radii (from 250-m to 25-km) and quantified the amount of
habitat and rainfall. We used a generalized linear model to quantify the relationship between
bobwhite abundance and habitat (or rainfall) at each buffer size and used psuedo-r2 to quantify
the strength of the relationship. In northern Texas, we documented a positive relationship
between bobwhite abundance and habitat and a negative relationship between abundance and
rainfall across all buffer sizes. The strongest relationship for both variables occurred at the 25-
km buffer (psuedo-r2=0.07 and 0.32, respectively). In southern Texas, we also documented a
positive relationship between bobwhite abundance and habitat, with the strongest relationship at
the 10-km and 25-km buffers (psuedo-r2=0.06). However, there were no significant
relationships between abundance and rainfall. Our results illustrate the strong influence that
scale may have on relationships and how failure to consider its influence may result in
contrasting conclusions.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
86,Anthropogenic and Climate Effects on Striped Skunk Observations via Game Camera,"Exponential human growth and the resulting urbanization and climate change of the
past few hundred years have affected wildlife. While these changes have been disastrous to
countless species, a few species are urban exploiters and urban adapters and remain abundant
through anthropogenic disturbance, including the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). We used
camera trap data from across the USA available through Snapshot to assess striped skunk
relationships with urbanization and weather. We expected fewer skunk observations in areas
with greater anthropogenic development. We then used generalized linear models with negative
binomial responses in RStudio to examine potential relationships between anthropogenic
covariates (cultivated land, wild vegetation, gross primary productivity, impervious ground cover,
and housing density) and weather covariates (maximum temperature, minimum temperature,
precipitation, and temperature difference) A total of 176,425 trap nights resulted in 482 skunk
detections. No anthropogenic covariates[SF1]  had a significant effect on skunk observations. In
2019, mean precipitation significantly affected the likelihood of skunk observations (p= 0.018),
with an inverse relationship between skunk observations and mean precipitation. In 2020,
average daily temperature difference (p= 0.009) and minimum temperature (p= 0.013) affected
skunk observations, with a direct relationship between both covariates and skunk observations.
Previous studies posit that skunk observations occur most frequently in areas of moderate
human disturbance. Since striped skunks are cryptic and did not appear very frequently on
camera, getting skunks in hand and tracking them via GPS collar may assist with further study
into anthropogenic effects on skunks.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
87,Scaled Quail Food Preference in West Texas,"Quail populations are declining across the United States. Scaled quail (Callipepla
squamata) have declined by 66% in Texas.  Identifying specific food preferences can allow
proper management of this species in West Texas where birds once flourished but have
declined due to poor land use practices. A few studies investigate the diet selection of scaled
quail and have been performed in Arizona and New Mexico. However, few have been limited in
west Texas. Enhancing plant species preferred across the landscape can provide viable
populations for future establishment by dispersal and provide connectivity between scaled quail
populations. Crop contents were analyzed from 60 harvested birds. Contents of each crop were
separated by seed, mast, vegetative, and insect. A total of 749 plant species were found in all
crops with 133 individual plants. This results in an average of 13 different plant species per
crop. Forbs were the most common component, followed by woody plants, succulents, grasses
and insects. Seeds represented 62% of the food components consumed. Seeds from woody
plants, grasses, and succulents are important and may provide a nutritional bridge that occurs
seasonally to meet energetic requirements.  Due to the diversity and abundance of forbs in
scaled quail diets, managers may be wise to carefully plan widespread applications of
herbicides (i.e Spike) on the landscape that result in forb kill if the management of scaled quail
is an important ranch objective.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA

distribution throughout Africa, and it is an important ecological and socioeconomic species, but
few studies exist on this species, especially in Senegal. In Niokolo Koba National Park, in the
southeast of Senegal, we studied the bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) distribution. Our first
objective is to investigate their spatial distribution across the entire protected area. The second
objective is to identify important landscape and habitat variables explaining their distribution. In
2013, we conducted a single-season camera survey at the park's study sites: Linguekountou

collected vegetation metrics at 30 locations per site. We deployed cameras for 2,014 trap nights
in Linguekountou and 1,707 trap nights in Niokolo. The trap nights have resulted in 4,511 animal
detections, which included 1,842 ungulate detections, including 425 bushbuck detections
(Linguekountou; n = 310, Niokolo; n = 115). We will use Maxent software and ArcGIS to model
bushbuck distribution and examine habitat use. This data will provide a better understanding of

89,Advancements in Population Monitoring: Evaluating Space to Event Models for White-Tailed Deer Surveys in Rangeland Ecosystems,"White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations play a crucial ecological role in
rangeland ecosystems and hold significant economic and conservation importance. White-tailed
deer populations are monitored via methods such as aerial surveys, spotlight counts, and trail
camera surveys. Each method offers a different combination of strengths and weaknesses in
terms of accuracy. Trail camera surveys have become popular due to ease of use but
population estimation from cameras without individually marked animals is challenging. For
instance, baited surveys can result in skewed sex and age ratios, leading to population
underestimation. Additionally, some methods require auxiliary data, such as animal movement
rates, which can be difficult to obtain. Recently, there have been developments in using space
to event (STE) models by using time-lapse settings in trail cameras. The STE model is based on
using the total area of the viewshed that is photographed until an animal is detected to generate
an estimate of animal density. We are evaluating STE models in a 92-ha, game-fenced site
containing White-tailed deer near Kingsville, Texas, USA. Results of the STE models will be
compared with White-tailed deer population estimates generated by baited camera surveys and
aerial drone surveys using thermal cameras. Successful implementation of the STE method
could offer a versatile, noninvasive approach applicable to species of large animals.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
90,Wildlife Disease Research In Texas: Trends Over The Past Three Decades,"Texas encompasses a unique geographical region that spans ten ecoregions and
hosts a diversity of wildlife. It is also a central point for major bird migratory flyways, hosts >
1930 km of international border with high movement of people and animals, and is situated in a
climatic region expected to warm significantly in the next few decades. These factors make
Texas a region of interest for understanding wildlife disease emergence and zoonotic disease
risk. Here, we reviewed three decades of literature reporting wildlife diseases in Texas to
understand regional and temporal trends. We utilized the Web of Science platform to perform a
literature review using the following search terms and Boolean operators: “disease” AND
“wildlife” AND “Texas”, which returned 772 primary research articles as of September 2023.
These were filtered by a strict set of criteria to identify >90 primary articles. We noted a gradual
increase in disease research in Texas with most studies focused on cervids, feral species (e.g.,
Sus scrofa), and species at the urban-wild interface (e.g., coyotes [Canis latrans] and raccoons
[Procyon lotor]). Pathogens that were most prevalent in the literature were vector-borne,
including Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease).
Zoonotic diseases comprised >50% of the literature reviewed. We acknowledge that, in part,
these trends reflect researcher interests and funding opportunities; however, it shouldn’t
diminish the importance of Texas as a geographically important region as species distributions
shift and vectors experience less seasonality with climate change.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
91,Assessing the Efficacy of Integrating Light Meters with GPS Transmitters for Use in Wildlife Research,"Vegetation cover and structure provide critical protection from abiotic conditions and
can limit predation risk for many wildlife species. Measures of overhead vegetation are typically
collected with handheld methods that are limited logistically at large scales, or remotely sensed,
which can be cost-prohibitive. Given the importance of overhead vegetation in structuring
ecological patterns and the difficulty of collecting this information, alternative methods to
estimate overhead vegetation is a critical need in wildlife research. Many wildlife tracking
devices are solar-powered and often collect light-intensity data that are typically used to assess
transmitter battery performance. As overhead vegetation cover intercepts light, light-intensity
data collected from these tracking devices may also be used as an index of overhead
vegetation cover. To explore this possibility, we tested the performance of GPS transmitters
equipped with a light meter and compared readings to scientific-grade light meters. In August
2023, we conducted 97 paired light meter comparisons in Dimmit County, Texas, USA. Within
stratified vegetation communities (Tamaulipan thornscrub or mesquite grassland), paired light
meters were deployed in low, medium, and high shrub cover areas. Data were collected every
hour for a minimum of 24 hours at each location. In addition to categorical measurements of
shrub cover, overhead leaf area index was collected using a ceptometer. Preliminary analyses
will explore the comparative relationship between light intensity and overhead vegetation cover
to determine if these data can act as a proxy for vegetation cover at locations used by wildlife
species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
92,Perceptions of Livestock Owners and Herders on Lion Coexistence in the Kalahari Landscape,"Human-lion conflict is likely to occur in areas where there is high livestock
encroachment into lion (Panthera leo) territories. In the Ghanzi District of Botswana, the number
of cattle posts (designated areas for keeping livestock) has grown rapidly in the last 50 years.
As a result, livestock depredation by lions has significantly increased. This is cause for concern
for both lion conservation and the economic sustainability of farmers’ livelihoods, especially
because this region provides critical connectivity between lion populations in the Central
Kalahari Game Reserve and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, two of the largest protected
areas in southern Africa. To effectively alleviate potential human-wildlife conflicts arising from
lion depredation, mitigation efforts should actively involve local stakeholders to ensure long-term
efficacy. However, these strategies are often implemented without consulting those who are
expected to coexist with wildlife. The objective of our study is to gauge the perceptions of
livestock owners and herders in the Ghanzi district coexisting with lions. We collected data
through a combination of face-to-face and telephone interviews in which respondents answered
a series of open-ended questions regarding their livestock management practices and past
experiences with wild predators. We asked respondents to share their ideas on human-lion
conflict mitigation and coexistence strategies. We will use cultural consensus analyses to
compare the perceptions of respondents according to their respective experiences with lions.
These results will provide valuable insight into which mitigation strategies are both effective and
acceptable to the farming community.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
93,Effects of Minimizing Soil Disturbance on Restoring Cedar-Elm Encroached Riparian Grasslands,"In the last 200 years, 80% of riparian corridors have disappeared in North America
and Europe. Riparian corridors are diverse and stable ecosystems that provide habitat for the
movement of wildlife. Woody plant encroachment of native and invasive trees within riparian
floodplain grasslands alters ecological services and hinders movement of wildlife. Native
perennial bunch grasses average 0.3-1m in height and root systems extend 3-5m. These deep
and fibrous root systems stabilize soil and assist in water infiltration in these riparian grasslands.
Woody encroachment on grasslands is a global phenomenon that is transitioning grasslands to
shrubland ecosystems. Woody plant encroachment of historical riparian floodplain grasslands
within Texas results in closed canopy hardwood forests with understories dominated by cool
season, annual grasses, and forbs that alter the below ground composition within these
ecosystems.  Biodiversity is essential for riparian corridors with 70% of vertebrate species
utilizing these corridors throughout their lifespan. Native cedar elm within the cross-timbers and
prairies region of Texas can become the dominant woody plant species within unmanaged
riparian floodplain grasslands, creating a monoculture that drastically alters the plant
community. Management and restoration efforts to restore these grasslands include prescribed
burning or intrusive soil tilling. Here, we investigate the efficacy of restoring a cedar elm
encroached riparian grassland through different seeding methods and minimizing soil
disturbance. This research will help develop and inform management decisions for the
restoration of historical riparian grasslands within central Texas as wildlife corridors.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
94,Effects of Feral Swine on the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of White-Tailed Deer,"White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and feral swine (Sus scrofa) engage in
interspecific competition for resources within ecological systems. Ordinarily, feral swine exert
competitive pressure, displacing white-tailed deer from the area, resulting in each species'
predominant occupation of distinct habitats. Nevertheless, certain circumstances may lead to
the co-occurrence of white-tailed deer and feral swine within the same habitat, fostering
resource-sharing dynamics. To better understand this relationship, we used game cameras to
conduct a multi-season analysis of the occurrence of white-tailed deer and feral swine in Palo
Pinto Mountains State Park in northcentral Texas. The objective is to evaluate both species'
occurrence patterns across various camera survey sites, focusing on investigating species'
temporal and spatial patterns for potential interspecies interactions. We have actively monitored
white-tailed deer, and feral swine since April 2021. Our methods involve placing 20 game
cameras 51 cm above ground level, in randomly selected locations, and spaced at least 250
meters apart. We will monitor white-tailed deer and feral swine at each camera site throughout
the summer and winter seasons from 2021 to 2023. We use TimeLapse software to evaluate
data collected from each camera site. Our findings will be shared with local wildlife management
authorities to further conservation and management practices to ensure the longevity of the
Parks ecosystem.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
95,Using Non-Invasive Technologies to Determine Species Richness and Abundance in Support of an Applied Conservation Genetics Project,"Measuring species presence and abundance can be useful for designing
conservation management plans, or as a first step in directing applied conservation genetics
projects. While there are many methods for measuring such attributes, trail cameras have
become very popular non-invasive tools for recording species richness, abundance, animal
behavior, and even identifying individual animals if unique markings or morphology are evident.
The purpose of this research was to measure coyote (Canis latrans) abundance and estimate
coyote morphology at sites in the Hill Country, San Antonio, and Galveston, TX areas. The
results of this project are being used to guide efforts for coyote scat collection, in support of a
larger applied conservation genetics research project. Multiple trail cameras were placed at
every site, each was baited, and a series of markers were used in the camera’s view to estimate
morphology of coyotes. Cameras were active for a minimum of 30 days at each site and after
collection, photos were analyzed to calculate trap events, trap success, species diversity and
evenness for all wildlife recorded. Morphology measurements were estimated for body length,
shoulder height, width of head and tail length, if and when they were visible in photos with a
scale present. The results of this research will be used to target areas for coyote scat collection,
to support a conservation genetics project that is investigating levels of hybridization present in
coyotes and analyzing diet of these animals.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
96,Efficacy of Juniper Removal on Plant Communities within Riparian Corridors in the Palo Pinto Mountains Region of Texas,"Riparian corridors contribute to landscape-level ecological diversity.  In semi-arid
rangelands, they exist as fragments and persist only because of the unique hydrologic regime of
the riparian zone. However, they also contribute, as well as the surrounding watershed
vegetation, to the hydraulic regime which they depend on. Woody encroachment of juniper
species into rangelands has widespread and ongoing impacts on grassland ecosystems and
their linked ecosystems. In this project we characterized the riparian community of several
ephemeral stream reaches prior to and following restoration activities along established riparian
buffers in Palo Pinto County, Texas. Based on information from historical aerial photos, field
measurements, and NRCS Ecological Site Descriptions, land use has significantly shifted the
plant community away from its presumed historic reference community. This work is done in
relation to restoration activities that include juniper removal to promote native community
diversity. Our results indicate that in the present state, riparian corridors are dominated by Ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei J. Buchholz); however, removal of large juniper alone doesn’t constitute
restoration. Adaptive management including litter dispersal, appropriate herbaceous seed
mixes, invasive species management, and woody species management at lower successional
states is needed to restore functional diversity to these riparian corridors.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
97,Impact of Minimizing Soil Disturbance on Restoring Mesquite Encroached Grasslands,"Woody plant encroachment is one of the greatest contemporary threats to mesic
grasslands of the central United States. Woody encroachment is estimated to result in the loss
of 75% of rangelands by 2040. Fire suppression, overgrazing, and land mismanagement has
resulted in expansive woody plant encroachment throughout Texas. Native Honey mesquite has
become a nuisance within Texas and invasive throughout the world. As percent canopy
composition of Honey mesquite increases so does the density and longevity of annual cool
season grasses resulting in a decrease of native perennial bunch grasses.  This alteration of the
herbaceous layer reduces forage availability for livestock and habitat for wildlife. Additionally,
woody plant encroachment transition of grasslands to shrubland ecosystems imperils grassland-
dwelling bird species populations. This reduction and loss of perennial bunch grasses results in
a decline of suitable habitats for species such as the Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus).
Other bird species are reliant on these grasslands for overwintering habitat. Recommended
restoration treatments for woody plant encroachment include the use of mechanical and
chemical tree removal which could interfere with essential ecosystem services. Additionally, soil
disturbance within grasslands damages roots, modifies soil composition and structure, and has
negative impacts on plant communities. Here we investigate the efficacy of minimizing soil
disturbance on establishing native grass within a Honey mesquite encroached grassland in
central Texas. We hypothesize that native warm-season grasses can be successfully seeded
into the historical grassland ecosystem restoring habitat for grassland-associated bird species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
98,Silver Bluestem as a Catalyst for Restoring Juniper Encroached Grasslands,"Grasslands comprise 20 to 40 percent of earth’s ecosystems and are declining
globally. Grasslands provide essential ecosystems services, are carbon sinks, and provide
habitat for a plethora of wildlife species. Woody plant encroachment transitions grassland
ecosystems to shrublands, impacting soil health and altering plant and wildlife species
composition. Within central Texas, overgrazing, fire suppression, and urban expansion has
enabled native Ashe Juniper to expand beyond its historical niche and encroach on grasslands.
Encroachment of Ashe juniper into these grasslands ecosystems results in a monocultural
landscape through the reduction or elimination of herbaceous layer biodiversity. This loss of
native deep-rooted grasses impacts grassland hydrology, decreasing surface water percolation,
resulting in increased surface water runoff and erosion. Ashe Juniper monoculture is limiting to
the availability of forage, browse, and habitat for wildlife and livestock, creating an understory
comprised of few fibrous rooted plants. Here, we investigate the efficacy of minimizing soil
disturbance during juniper removal and subsequent reintroduction of native grasses using early
successional silver bluestem seeded directly into juniper duff for prairie restoration. We
hypothesize that silver bluestem can germinate and thrive in juniper duff piles, restoring the
herbaceous grass layer and increasing surface water percolation.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
99,Spatial Patterns of Canid Diet and Maternal Haplotype Groups in South Texas,"Red wolves (Canis rufus) are a critically endangered species native to the eastern
United States, but despite conservation efforts, their population size has declined. In recent
years, it was discovered that coyotes (Canis latrans) in the region of Galveston Island, TX
retained red wolf alleles thought lost in the captive-bred population, meaning the two species
had hybridized in the past. This project is currently analyzing the diet of canids (coyotes and
unknown hybrids) in the Galveston region of Texas and assessing the spatial distribution of their
diet components. Canid scat samples were collected around the Galveston Island, TX region
and are being analyzed through DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing to
determine the maternal haplotypes of canids and identify the prey item(s) consumed. The scat
samples are also being analyzed in ArcGIS Pro in order to better understand the spatial
distribution of these canids and determine whether there are any patterns in prey items,
landcover type, and maternal haplotype of the source canid.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
100,Utilization of the Hunt Trap Method to Investigate the Small Mammal Community in an Upland Pine Stand,"Small mammals are important components in forest ecosystems as they can affect
successional and vegetation patterns through their occurrence, diets, and behaviors. In turn,
small mammals can serve as biological indicators of ecosystem quality. Our goal was to test the
effectiveness of the Hunt Trap method in detecting the small mammal community of an upland
pine stand. This trapping technique provides a noninvasive methodology for sampling small
mammal communities. We deployed nine baited Hunt Traps in the Stephen F. Austin
Experimental Forest in Nacogdoches, Texas. Inside the Hunt Trap, we used a Reconyx
HyperFire programmed camera to take a burst of three pictures when motion is detected, with a
one-minute delay before the next detection. Cameras were deployed to record data during
March 2023 (31 days) to observe small mammal occurrences to determine daily activity periods
and the CPUE for any potential detections. Two species (Neotoma floridana and Peromyscus
spp.) of small mammals were detected. The observed species in the genus Peromyscus were
grouped due to the inability to differentiate between species. Nine non-target species were also
detected. Results highlight that small mammal activity periods were greatest from hours 0000 to
0600 and CPUE results showed the highest was Peromyscus spp., while the lowest CPUE was
Neotoma floridana. Our findings suggest that the Hunt trap method can be utilized to evaluate
small mammal in upland pine stands. With further implications of this method management
personnel and researchers can observe species communities to assist in planning future
management practices.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
101,White-Tailed Deer Spatial Ecology in an Agricultural Environment,"Throughout the United States, wildlife species are influenced by many agricultural
factors, including row-crop farming, which can affect prominent species such as white-tailed
deer. Fragmentation from cropland conversion can shift the spatial ecology of white-tailed deer,
thereby influencing life-history characteristics. Movement characteristics of white-tailed deer
vary over the species’ large geographic range; however, region-specific data is necessary for
effective management, especially in areas of dense cropland where species-specific information
is lacking. In the Rolling Plains of Texas, we GPS-collared ten (five female, five male) white-
tailed deer and monitored their movements from November 2014 to March 2017. The mean
home range size was 5.48 km2 (SD=2.91) via dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement models. On
average white-tailed deer spent a moderate (7.5% ± 3.2; x̅ ± SD) amount of time in agriculture
but this varied by sex. Females spent more time in agriculture (10.4% ± 4.0) than males (5.1% ±
3.9). January and February had the greatest mean cropland use (35.7% ± 13.5) while June and
July had the lowest cropland use (0.2% ± 13.5). Individuals generally remained <5 km from
cropland throughout the year (3,000 m ± 2,761), a distance white-tailed deer can easily traverse
multiple times a day. Females used areas closer to cropland (1,431 m ± 6,592) than males
(4,239 m ± 5,341). Our results illustrate that spatial and temporal shifts in movement
characteristics by white-tailed deer may be driven by row-crop farming in this region which could
modify spatial-habitat relationships that can be used to determine future management efforts.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
102,An Assessment of Bird Building Collisions on the University of Texas at San Antonio’s Main Campus,"Bird-building collisions are a top cause of bird mortality in the United States (US).
Because San Antonio, Texas is located prominently in the Central Flyway, incidences of bird-
building collisions are anticipated to be high, especially during migration when the number of
birds is elevated. Despite these ideas, assessments of bird-building collisions in San Antonio
are limited. In response to this missing gap in knowledge, we recorded the presence of bird-
building collisions on the main campus of The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) in
2019, and from January 2021 through December 2023 taking a semi-systematic approach with
emphasis on Spring and Fall migration. We documented 107 birds from 28 species of which the
majority (23 species) were migratory and five are currently considered Species of Greatest
Conservation Need (SGCN) in Texas. Nashville Warbler (Leiothlypis ruficapilla; 14), Orange-
crowned Warbler (Vermivora celata; 11), and Lincoln’s Sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii; 10) were
the most commonly detected species. In support of our prediction, the majority of collisions
occurred during migration (September and October - 71.96%; April - 11.21%). While bird
building collisions occurred throughout campus, two hotspots were revealed; we suggest that
trees nearby serving as roosts coupled with large windows may have elevated collisions at
these locations. Future research incorporating year-round, systematic surveys coupled with
analysis of landscape features will be used to evaluate these ideas. Results from this ongoing
study will be provided to UTSA to encourage adoption of mitigation methods that decrease bird-
building collisions on campus.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
103,Estimating the Proportion of Northern Pintails Available to be Surveyed During the Annual North American Waterfowl Breeding Survey,"Different techniques to estimate animal population parameters can provide differing
and sometimes opposing results. These differences must be accounted for, particularly when
used for management. For example, aerial surveys are used to estimate abundance and
distribution of breeding waterfowl using densities along transects and extrapolating to the larger
target regions located within Western Dakota and Montana. While these surveys efficiently
estimate interannual variability in population distributions they do not explicitly capture highly
dynamic settlement patterns which greatly influence population estimates. Northern pintail
(Anas acuta) breeding distributions depend heavily on highly ephemeral wetlands, therefore
exhibit great annual variability. Our goal is to understand the proportion of pintails within the
survey area during the time of the North American Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat
Survey. We deployed GSM/GPS tracking devices on 665 female pintails wintering throughout
central and western wintering regions of North America (TX/LA Gulf Coast, TX Panhandle, NM,
AZ, and CA) during 2020-2023. Of those marked birds, 244 birds reached their respective
breeding areas, providing us adequate data to use in our analysis. We will use a nonparametric
analysis to assess whether the daily number of pintails per unit area in each survey stratum is
similar to that of non-surveyed areas within the Prairie Pothole Region. We will similarly
compare the number of birds within the belt transects available during the survey period to that
within the target survey area. These comparisons will provide insights into the efficacy of the
breeding survey for northern pintails and potentially refine population estimates.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
104,Spatial and Temporal Responses of Small Cats to the Presence of Big Cat Species in Central Botswana,"As wild cat population trends steadily decline due to habitat loss and ever-growing
human-wildlife conflicts, there is great need for conservation of these species. Wild cat
populations should be studied on both public and private land to gain a deeper understanding of
challenges they face and ways their population numbers could be boosted. We examined the
spatial and temporal overlap in the populations of big and small cats on the Central Kalahari
Game Reserve (national park) and a privately owned, high-fenced hunting property using
camera traps.  From March to June of 2023, we deployed 2 cameras at each of 104 different
sites, with 52 sites per property. Photos were categorized by species and number of individuals
using the program Timelapse, and then exported to an excel file for analysis.  The high-fenced
Bokamoso property experienced about half as many detections as the Central Kalahari Game
Reserve. Caracals (Caracal caracal), servals (Leptailurus serval), and cheetahs (Acinonyx
jubatus) appeared to avoid areas where lions (Panthera leo) and leopards (Panthera pardus)
are present on both properties. However, the African wildcat (Felis lybica), the smallest species
of interest, tended to stay within the area. When similar species avoid one another, it produces
a healthier coexistence by reducing competition among species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
105,Ocelot Dispersion and Guzzler Use on Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge,"Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) conservation at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife
Refuge faces challenges related to man-made water sources (hereafter ‘guzzlers’), which
maintain consistent encounters with ocelots for research. Guzzler maintenance was historically
managed by interns; however, due to budget constraints and the COVID-19 pandemic,
maintenance ceased. Cluster camera surveys to refine the ocelot population estimate were
initiated in early summer 2023 and consistent ocelot encounters have been observed at the
refuge’s water guzzlers. Notably, 3 frequent visitors (2 males, 1 female) were identified at one
guzzler and 2 additional females were observed at another. Inspired by these findings, cameras
were placed at all 13 guzzlers to capture additional instances of ocelot activity, with data
collection underway. During camera checks, we observed that some guzzlers appeared dry or
clogged. This lack of maintenance was concerning because non-functioning guzzlers may
discourage ocelot use. Recently, there have been renewed efforts to maintain guzzlers through
volunteer initiatives. Our research aims to provide data on guzzler utilization by ocelots and
raise awareness about the importance of guzzlers for ocelot conservation. Examining the
connection between guzzler water availability and consistent ocelot visits, potentially
highlighting the correlation between ocelot encounters and areas with functioning guzzlers. Our
study further investigates how guzzler condition affects ocelot dispersal and explores the impact
of supplemental water sources on home range expansion, survival during dispersal, and
connectivity between dispersal areas. Our research contributes essential information to
understanding ocelot behavior around guzzlers and their role in ocelot dispersal, emphasizing
their significance for conservation efforts.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
106,Winter Site Fidelity of Female Northern Pintails Using High-Resolution GPS Data,"Site fidelity is a phenomenon observed in a broad array of species, particularly those
that migrate. Some shorebirds return every year to the same nest cup and wintering site,
whereas some finches are entirely nomadic, following highly dynamic resources across their
range. Waterfowl fall somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. In North America, the northern
pintail (Anas acuta) shows highly-variable winter-site fidelity. However, much of our knowledge
on winter site fidelity relies on band recoveries, which are hindered by often very low recapture
rates. Automated tracking devices that use the cell phone network (GSM) or satellites allow
continuous tracking of animals. These devices provide valuable new insight into distributions of
animals across seasons. Using this technology, we seek to better understand winter site fidelity
of the highly mobile northern pintail. We deployed GPS/GSM tracking devices on 665 female
pintails wintering in the Gulf Coast, Playa Lakes Region, and the Southwest U.S., and a total of
69 individuals returned to wintering areas the year following deployment. We will assess
different levels (spatial scale) of winter site fidelity of pintails using Bhattacharyya’s Affinity Index
to measure degree of overlap of utilization distributions across successive winters, as well as
Euclidean distance between centroids of home ranges between winters. We expect low site
fidelity birds captured in dryer areas (Playa Lakes, Southwest), but higher fidelity in birds
returning to the coastal regions (Texas Coast, Louisiana), due to the latter region’s general
overall stability in wetland availability relative to the former.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
107,Endoparasite Occurrence in Sympatric Bighorn Sheep and Aoudad in the Trans- Pecos Region of Texas,"Population decline of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) in the Trans-
Pecos ecoregion of Texas is a subject of burgeoning concern for wildlife biologists.  In many
parts of their range, much of this decline is in part caused by mortalities and reduced
recruitment from exotic pathogens originally introduced to free-ranging ungulates by domestic
livestock.  Additionally, aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), an invasive Caprid originating from Africa,
may facilitate the spread of pathogens that can cross species barriers, such as certain
endoparasites.  Determining parasite species presence and abundance in sympatric bighorn
and aoudad using techniques such as fecal egg counts (FEC) is the first step in exploring this
possibility.  We used the modified McMaster technique, which is the most commonly utilized
method to quantify parasite load in ruminants, and the Wisconsin technique to quantify parasite
presence.  Fecal samples were obtained from 22 bighorn and 13 aoudad captured in the Black
Gap Wildlife Management Area and Big Bend Ranch State Park in October-November 2023,
where 82% of bighorn samples and 54% of aoudad samples contained at least one species of
endoparasite.  Three genera were detected in both bighorn and aoudad combined, where
Ascaris ovis, a form of roundworm, and other ascarids were frequently observed in both
species.  Other parasites observed in both bighorn and aoudad included Eimeria spp. and
strongyle-type species.  These preliminary results support the notion that a larger, more
comprehensive study of gastrointestinal parasite occurrence in these species may be
warranted, especially as aoudad densities continue to rise.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
108,Effect of Weather and Urbanization on the Activity of Virginia Opossums in the US,"Urbanization affects wildlife, but each species reacts differently to urbanization.
Research has found that mesopredators avoid highly urbanized areas while benefiting from
urban resources simultaneously.  Additionally, studies show that Virginia opossums (Didelphis
virginiana) are more active in areas with steady precipitation. With this in mind, we hypothesized
that Virginia opossums would be more active in urban areas and areas with a higher mean
precipitation. For the methodology, we used publicly available Snapshot USA data that gathered
camera data from locations across the US. Our anthropogenic covariates included cultivated
land and wild vegetation, and our weather covariates included precipitation and minimum
temperature. The calculated p-values from our study were: 2019 mean precipitation (p=0.024),
2020 mean precipitation (p=1.01e-07), for 2019 wild vegetation (p=0.0001), 2020 wild
vegetation (p=0.004), 2020 minimum temperature (p=3.28e-05), and 2020 cultivated land (p=
0.012).  Based on our results, Virginia opossum counts are positively correlated with mean
precipitation, minimum temperature, and cultivated land, and negatively correlated with wild
vegetation. Suggested future studies would be how the activity of other mesopredators affects
the activity of Virginia opossums.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
109,Factors Influencing Diets of Wild Pigs,"Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are one of the most damaging invasive species worldwide,
given their high reproductive potential, large size, and omnivorous diet. Their rapid expansion
has increased concerns for disease transmission, impacts on agriculture production, and effects
on ecosystems. If not properly managed, wild pigs could cause extensive, possibly irreversible,
damage to native ecosystems. My goal is to document the diet composition of wild pigs in the
Neches River Basin of the Piney Woods region of Texas seeking to make specific inference
about factors influencing changes in diet among animals throughout the year to determine
influence of environmental factors throughout each calendar season, determine influence of age
and sex on diets, and determine the influence of parasite presence on diets. I am collecting a
minimum of 10 specimens per season for sample collection of ectoparasites, feces, and
stomach contents from each wild pig harvested. All samples will be processed in order to
identify the abundance of parasites from each individual, identify items consumed, and
abundance of each food type consumed. These findings will then be used for analysis to
determine if any significant associations of any combined relationships exist. Understanding the
feeding habits in combination with possible factors influencing those habits may increase the
success of management plans. If any significant correlations can be found, these results can be
implemented into the timing of management efforts across the area creating more efficient
success for those wanting to decrease and manage wild pig populations to reduce ecological
and economic impacts.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
110,"Fire Suppression Chemicals: Use, Effectiveness and Perceptions The Testing of EarthClean TetraKO™","Wildland fire suppression chemicals (defined as any additive to water used to
improve effectiveness as an extinguishing agent such as foams, retardants, and water
enhancers) have a long history of use in wildland firefighting. Since their introduction in the
1930s, phosphate-based chemicals have been utilized in wildfire suppression strategies. In
recent years, 50 million gallons of chemical fire retardant have been used to fight wildfires
annually. A major issue posed by the use of most suppression chemicals is their concentration
and accumulation in the environment post-burn. The toxicity of common suppression chemicals
has been well documented and known to cause harm to soils and waterways. With recent
increases in fire activity and intensity, the demand for safer, more environmentally friendly
suppression chemicals will rise. Newer “biodegradable” suppression chemicals, such as
TetraKO™, advertise themselves as environmentally friendly alternatives to the phosphate-
based agents commonly used today. In this study, we test TetraKO™, a cornstarch-based
product, under four replicated application conditions to evaluate its effectiveness and
performance. We hypothesize that TetraKO™ will stop the advance of fire more often than
water alone, even after a drying period. Additionally the non-toxic component reduces post-burn
negative impacts on the environment from suppression operations. Perceptions of wildland fire
suppression chemical use may be drastically improved if “safe”, “eco-friendly” products were
highly effective as control lines and water additives for suppression. Pending the results of this
study, a successful performance of biodegradable suppression chemicals would make a new
tool available to land managers, particularly in sensitive ecosystems.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
111,Illuminating Painted Bunting breeding season diets at Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area using fecal eDNA metabarcoding,"Of the two breeding populations in the United States, the western Painted Bunting
(Passerina ciris) population is comparatively understudied. As this species’ populations are
declining, gaining a more comprehensive view of habitat requirements on breeding grounds is
needed. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the diet of Painted Buntings breeding in North Texas at
Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (Denton Co., TX) to illuminate the food resources
needed by this population. Painted Bunting diets were last analyzed over 100 years ago using
lethal sampling methods, whereas technological advances now enable use of non-invasive
methods, like fecal eDNA metabarcoding. Despite growing interest in this approach, it has been
used relatively infrequently for birds compared to mammals. We non-invasively collected feces
from Painted Buntings across all three periods of the 2023 breeding season (pre-nesting,
breeding/nesting, and post-breeding) for diet analysis. We predicted that more arthropods are
consumed during the breeding season, a pattern that would be most pronounced in females,
and that during the post-breeding period more seeds would be found in the diet. This diet
assessment will not only expand and refine foundational information for this species, but also
provide invaluable habitat use data for the management of Painted Buntings in Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
112,Evaluating the Effect of Origin and Super-Stocking Methods on the Genetics of Eastern Wild Turkey,"In the early 1900’s, wild turkey populations were nearly extirpated from North
America due largely to unregulated hunting. Even after the implementation of hunting
restrictions, Eastern Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) populations in eastern Texas
struggled to recover. The Texas Parks & Wildlife Department has recently adopted a novel
translocation strategy known as super-stocking that involves simultaneously releasing ~80 wild
birds of mixed origin at each site. According to preliminary data, birds sourced from Texas
represented 61% of total super-stocked birds, Iowa represented 8.7%, and nine other states
accounted for the remaining 30.3%. Our aim was to determine if super-stock sources exert
influence on the current genetic diversity of M. silvestris in eastern Texas. According to
anecdotal evidence, birds trapped in some states may be contributing more to the current
population of M. silvestris than others and the genetic composition of a super-stocked
population may influence its ability to establish in an area. Genetic analysis will be performed on

contribution of each source to the current population. Our findings will inform the selection of

113,Response of Female Northern Pintail to Thermal Variation During Spring Migration,"Dynamic climatic conditions during spring migration add additional costs to birds
already under selective pressure to maximize fitness by optimizing time and energy. Increasing
metabolic rate due to cold or hot temperatures adds physiological costs. Energy expended to
respond to these costs can further compound energetic stress throughout daily and seasonal
movements. Compounding energetic costs have implications for subsequent fitness. Under
predicted climate change, increasing incidence of extreme weather events and warming trends
will increase the importance of temperature variability during migration as a dynamic energetic
factor. The northern pintail (Anas acuta) arrives earlier than most ducks to breed in the Prairie
Pothole Region, likely pushing its thermal limits. However, pintails also show shifting migration
phenology related to spring warming trends. Our first objective is to model how female northern
pintails respond to temperature-induced metabolic costs via their activity patterns during spring
migration at hourly, daily, and seasonal scales. We then will predict the effects of climate
change on pintails’ migratory activity budgets at multiple scales. Female pintails wintering in the
US Gulf Coast, Playa Lakes and Southwest Regions were fitted with GSM GPS/ACC
transmitters from 2019-2023. Under a generalized additive modeling framework, we will
determine the relationship between temperature-linked existence metabolism and overall
dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) given the interaction of spatial, temporal, and demographic
covariates. This multi-scale approach will provide a more mechanistic understanding of
waterfowl migration energetics in relation to climatic conditions, and will be informative for
waterfowl management under future climate change.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
114,"Space Use, Movement, and Survival of Translocated Desert Bighorn Sheep in Sonora, Mexico","Mountain sheep abundance across North America has declined >60% from historic
times. In response, state and federal agencies have conducted >1,000 reintroduction projects,
translocating >21,000 bighorn sheep. Despite these efforts, ~50% of reintroductions are
considered unsuccessful, leading researchers to stress the importance of post-release
monitoring on the overall success of future reintroductions. Our objectives were to quantify
space use, movement, and survival of translocated desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis
mexicana). We conducted our research in the Sierra El Alamo Mountains, ~45 km W of
Caborca, in northwestern Sonora, Mexico. We captured and fitted 16 bighorn sheep (9 females,
7 male) with GPS collars, which collected 1 GPS fix every 3 hours starting in November 2023.
We created monthly 95% Brownian bridge movement models (BBMM), calculated monthly
distance travelled, and used the Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate survival. Monthly home
range size for females was greatest in April (1,319 ha) and least in September (291 ha).
Similarly, for males, home range size was greatest in February (1,533 ha) and least in October
(513 ha). Cumulatively, movement was greatest from April through June (~49 km) for females
and from February through April (~52 km) for males; movement was least in October and
December for both sexes. Annual survival (November 2023 to November 2024) was 81%
(13/16) for both sexes. Early post-monitoring data suggest the reintroduction effort was
successful because annual survival was high, and reintroduced sheep joined herds with native
sheep and settled into the study area quickly.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
115,Movement and foraging ecology of south Texas mountain lions (Puma concolor),"Anthropogenic structures, such as fences, walls, or highways, can have profound
influences on wildlife populations via fragmented habitats, impeded movement, and genetic
isolation. These structural barriers affect populations of large mammals worldwide, yet few
studies have quantified barrier impacts. Such research is particularly pressing considering the
construction of the ~1500km border barrier-system separating the United States and México.
We will conduct one of the first evaluations of the potential impacts of the U.S.-México border
barrier-system on movement and foraging ecology of a large carnivore, the mountain lion (Puma
concolor). Objectives are to assess effects of the border barrier-system on 1) transboundary
movements, 2) diet composition and kill rates, and 3) cause-specific mortality. We will capture at
least 20 lions and fit them with GPS collars equipped with geofencing that initiates high-fix rates
near the border. We will conduct integrated step selection and barrier behavior analyses to
examine the effects of the border on selection and movement. We will quantify diet through kill-
site investigations and DNA metabarcoding of scat samples. We will monitor survival and
cause-specific mortality by conducting mortality investigations. The broader implications of this
project are sizable, as Texas is the only state in the U.S. where mountain lions are not formally
managed and considered non-game. Additionally, population trends have not been tracked and
this population exists alongside a formidable anthropogenic barrier. By investigating the effects
of the U.S.-México border on a wide-ranging carnivore, we can inform mitigation and
management strategies locally and provide inference for at-risk carnivore populations globally.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
116,Preliminary Field Data and Proposed Experiments for Evaluating Efficacy and the Detection Limits of Alligator Snapping Turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) Environmental DNA (eDNA),"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is a large freshwater turtle
native to the southeastern United States.  Due to declining populations across its range, the
species is a candidate for listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.  Its range
extends into East Texas, but detailed information on its status in Texas is limited due to its
cryptic behavior and low detectability.  Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a valuable tool in
determining the presence of rare or cryptic species, particularly in aquatic environments.
Previous efforts suggest that eDNA surveys may be a useful tool to detect alligator snapping
turtles, but these studies were limited in temporal scope.  Here we present preliminary field data
for the first three-month sampling period of sites where alligator snapping turtles are known to
occur.  These preliminary data will aid in evaluating the efficacy of eDNA sampling across a
temporal scale, with the complete data set allowing for seasonal analyses.  We also present
proposed mesocosm experiments to examine how water quality within an aquatic system (e.g.,
flow rate, temperature, pH, and turbidity) may influence the detection efficacy of alligator
snapping turtle eDNA.  Controlled laboratory experiments will be used to evaluate detection
limits as might be influenced by eDNA concentration and exposure to changes in temperature
and pH.  Results from this study will inform researchers on the potential utility and limitation for
eDNA detection in monitoring alligator snapping turtles and other cryptic species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
117,Ocelot Reproduction and Kitten Survival in South Texas,"Estimation of vital rates, including reproduction, is critical to understanding complex
population dynamics, particularly for small, declining populations. Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis)
are a federally-listed species whose current range in the United States is restricted to two small,
isolated populations in South Texas. Our proposed research will aim to elucidate three key data
gaps for ocelots in the United States: (1) first-year survival rates of ocelots; (2) timing and
frequency of ocelot reproductive events; and (3) drivers of ocelot den site selection, with the
goal of informing an integrated population model (IPM) to guide ocelot recovery. We aim to
place expandable radio-linked VHF (rVHF) collars on ocelot kittens to assess first-year survival.
The kittens’ rVHF collars communicate with the mothers’ GPS collar periodically to update
neonate status as nearby, absent, or deceased. These data will be analyzed in a Cormack-
Jolly-Seber model in a Bayesian framework. Multivariate linear regression will be utilized to
assess what factors (e.g., season, rainfall, vegetation cover, mother's age, mother’s number of
previous litters) affect reproductive timing and frequency. A resource selection framework will be
applied to analyze what factors (e.g., patch configuration, vegetation composition, and human-
related factors such as distance from road) influence den establishment, and if those factors
differ, what influences overall habitat selection. Providing insights into first-year ocelot survival
will directly inform an integrated population model to guide ocelot recovery in the United States.
In addition, knowing what factors are associated with reproductive timing and den site selection
will guide ongoing, large-scale restoration of Tamaulipan thornscrub.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
118,Avian and Vegetation Response to Grassland Restoration in the Texas Cross Timbers Ecoregion,"Woody and invasive plant encroachment in grasslands is a major cause of grassland
bird population declines in North America. In the Cross Timbers ecoregion, Ashe juniper
(Juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), King Ranch bluestem (Bothriochloa
ischaemum) and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) convert native grasslands into dense shrublands
and monocultures that are unsuitable for obligate grassland bird species such as grasshopper
sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum). Our objective is to assess the impact of restoration on
the avian community by comparing avian abundance and plant community composition, canopy
cover, and density across time. Our study area is in Palo Pinto Mountains State Park in
northcentral Texas. We will conduct vegetation surveys during April and September with
fourteen 100m line transects using quadrat sampling for herbaceous species and the line
intercept method for woody species for 3 years, including pre- and post-restoration. Bird surveys
will be conducted for 4 periods/year using eight 20x100m line transects and 4 point counts
spaced >200m apart for 3 years. We plan to remove woody and invasive species and reseed at
an 8-ha upland section in early 2024. We have collected preliminary vegetation data in July
2023 and will collect preliminary bird data in early December 2023. This project will supplement
an ongoing 8-year riparian restoration project at the state park, provide songbird habitat,
improve surface water capture and nutrient cycling, and provide a demonstration site of cost-
effective ecosystem restoration and land management practices.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
119,Using Targeted Poisoning of Red Imported Fire Ants to Improve Texas Horned Lizard Habitat,"The spread of red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta; RIFA) has frequently been
cited as a factor contributing to the decline of the Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum;
THL). Two hypotheses for this are: 1) direct lizard mortality due to RIFA, and 2) displacement of
THL’s main food source, harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex spp.), by RIFA. A new third hypothesis
suggests that the invasion of RIFA could be causing a decline in hatchling THL food resources,
as their diet is mainly composed of small ant species. Many studies have attempted widespread
treatment to eradicate RIFA; however, this could have unintended consequences for non-target
ant species that THL depend on. Using a targeted application method, we sought to reduce
RIFA populations over the summers of 2022 and 2023 at four sites located at Mason Mountain
Wildlife Management in central Texas, a locality with an ongoing THL reintroduction program. At
each site, hot dog baits were placed 5 meters apart in 10x10 grids. At treatment sites, one
teaspoon of Amdro (a common ant poison) was applied to baits with RIFA thirty minutes after
placement. After Amdro was applied, baits were left for 30 minutes and then collected.
Treatments were repeated monthly May – August. The effects of each targeted poisoning were
evaluated using pitfall traps and ant abundance measurements from baits. Results showed no
clear trends in RIFA and hatchling food abundance over time. This suggests that our minimal
approach to targeted poisoning was not enough to significantly reduce RIFA activity at our sites.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
120,Nutritive Value Dynamics and Strategic Supplementation of White-tailed Deer Browse Species in the Southern Cross Timbers and Prairies of Texas,"In the Southern Cross Timbers and Prairies Region of Texas, white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus) are both a recreationally and economically valuable resource. Though
nutritional value influences selection, forage availability tends to be the major limiting factor of
high-quality diet selection. Forage nutritive value and availability, however, varies among and
within growing seasons, as well as among years. The intent of this work is to evaluate how
commonly used supplementation regimens (i.e., whole corn, cotton seed meal, and alfalfa)
affect the digestion of first and second choice browse species relative to no supplementation on
a seasonal basis. Starting in January 2023, seasonal browse samples were collected from a
ranch located near Cross Plains, TX. Browse samples of six different species (chittamwood,
elbowbush, winged elm, post oak, live oak, and skunkbush) were collected from two different
ecological sites, loamy bottomland and clay loam. Nutritional constituents of browse samples
were determined, including crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber
(ADF), lignin, and fat. Ruminal digestibility was estimated using in vitro true digestibility
methodology (IVTDMD), with all species within an ecosite being incubated concurrently with
each supplement.  There was an interaction of species and season for NDF and ADF (P <
0.01), with both following the same relative trend within a species. There was an interaction of
species and season, as well as an effect of supplement for IVTDMD (P < 0.05). Browse nutrient
availability and IVDMD changed seasonally with the greatest digestibility and least fibrous
constituents in the spring and summer.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
121,Tree Species Identity or Forest Structure: Restoration Implications for Small Mammal Diversity in Southern Pine Forests,"Industrial forest management practices converted historic native pine species forests
(e.g., shortleaf pine [Pinus echinata]) to homogenous, high-density plantations consisting of
native off-site species (e.g., loblolly pine [Pinus taeda]). Restoration efforts have been aimed at
converting these sites back to historical upland pine forests utilizing species that were more
commonly found in the site, which typically integrates one of two approaches: 1) a conversion
strategy, which involves replacing off-site species with preferred historic pine species, but this
approach can be fairly intensive and costly, or 2) the retention strategy which emphasizes forest
structure over species identity and is more gradual and less intrusive on the landscape.
However, the impact of each of these restoration strategies on small mammal diversity is not
well understood. We sought to determine the relative strengths of two factors (pine species
identity vs. forest structural characteristics) on an ecosystem service (support of biodiversity).
Specifically, using Hunt camera traps, we recorded small mammal occurrences across six
treatments that differed in tree species composition (monoculture forests of loblolly pine,
monoculture forests of shortleaf pine, or mixed shortleaf-loblolly pine forests) and covariates
that measure forest structure from two treatments (understory mulched or unmulched). We
found that covariates describing forest structure was a stronger predictor of small mammal
community composition (species richness and structure) as compared to pine species identity.
These results suggest a retention, rather than a conversion, approach to restoration can still
support biodiversity in forest ecosystems while achieving restoration objectives.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
122,Effects of Prescribed Fire on Herbaceous Nearest-Neighbor Relationships,"Fire has played a crucial role in shaping and maintaining plant communities in Texas
rangelands for centuries. However, the absence of periodic fire in fire-adapted ecosystems has
caused significant shifts in vegetation composition. While previous studies in rangelands have
explored the impact of prescribed fire on various herbaceous vegetation aspects, there is a
notable research gap regarding the effects of prescribed fire on relationships between nearest-
neighboring plants. Our research addresses this gap by evaluating how different prescribed fire
regimes, characterized by varied return intervals and burning seasons, influence interactions
among herbaceous plants in the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes ecoregion of South Texas.
Our study was conducted at the East Foundation's El Sauz ranch, where sixteen burn units
(>200 hectares) were randomly assigned either winter, summer, or control (no burn) treatments
at either short (3 years) or long (5 years) return intervals in 2016. We conduct six modified step-
point transects per burn unit pre-burning, ~6, ~12, ~18, and ~24 months post-burning, and in
control units concurrently. Transects capture ground cover, nearest herbaceous plant species,
nearest rooted neighboring herbaceous species, and the distance between the two plants.
Preliminary data indicate that significant positive associations are found more frequently during
summer sampling than during winter sampling. Additionally, there is an increase in total
significant positive associations in burn plots following fire. The research findings will provide
insights for land managers, aiding in the development of precise prescribed burning
prescriptions to meet specific management objectives.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
123,Patterns of Microhabitat Use by Texas Tortoises in a Southern Texas Coastal Rangeland,"Understanding habitat relationships at multiple scales aids in producing effective
management recommendations for wildlife species. For example, macrohabitat associations
can be useful in conducting species surveys across a broader geographic range, while
assessing microhabitat associations examines more specific resource use and has utility in
forming site management plans. Limited research exists on such relationships for the Texas
tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri), a species listed as threatened in Texas, where it ranges in the
southern portion of the state. Generally, Texas tortoises are known to use thornscrub grassland
vegetation. However, thornscrub grassland is a broad term that does not describe the finer
scale variation in vegetation class cover within this vegetation community across space. We
attached radio transmitters to Texas tortoises and assessed their microhabitat associations on a
coastal rangeland in southern Texas to determine more detailed patterns of resource use. We
examined the vegetation cover types and overall canopy cover at 1m above ground used by
tortoises at the East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch in Kenedy and Willacy Counties. We collected
microhabitat data at 253 tortoise locations, along with 2 random locations for each tortoise
location (506 random locations) to compare microhabitat use to availability. Texas tortoises
appear to use areas with higher overall canopy cover and woody vegetation cover than is
generally available, although they exhibit use of a variety of vegetation cover types. These finer
scale assessments of Texas tortoise microhabitat use are necessary to inform
recommendations for management action throughout their range to support their conservation.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
124,Microclimate Influence on Sound Propagation in a Woody-Grassland Mosaic,"Sound plays a pivotal role in shaping animals’ understanding of their environment
and dictating their responses, particularly with regard to communication. The acoustic
adaptation hypothesis posits that organisms structure their calls to optimize propagation within
their local environment. Factors influencing transmission of sound in terrestrial landscapes
include temperature, humidity, and vegetation structure. With the onset of climate change, these
factors are undergoing shifts from their historical conditions, which may lead to changes in local
soundscapes. Moreover, within the Great Plains, USA, significant alterations to abiotic
conditions and ecosystem processes have led to woody plant encroachment (WPE) within
grasslands, compounding changes in microclimate patterns across scales. It is likely that higher
temperatures and increased woody vegetation structure are lowering the detectability of sounds
and increasing attenuation rates. Thus, we sought to identify how variation in these factors are
impacting sound transmission in a woody-grassland mosaic. Beginning in Fall 2023, sounds will
be propagated and recorded along transects in grassland and juniper-encroached areas. Sound
propagation will occur across four different temperature ranges to capture thermal variation
across seasons. Experimental removal of woody vegetation will be conducted to quantify
changes in propagation under simulated management scenarios. Vegetation structure will be
measured along each of the transects before and after vegetation removal. Impacts of
temperature, canopy structure, and the interaction of these two factors on sound transmission
will be determined. Results will help highlight expected changes on soundscapes of the Great
Plains within the auspices of WPE and climate change pressures.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
125,Is Detectability of Texas Tortoises Affected by Time of Day or Temperature?,"Texas tortoises (Gopherus berlandieri) are a state threatened species in Texas that
has experienced sharp declines in population number, and its distribution has become sporadic.
Because of their decline, conservation agencies desire to enumerate remaining populations;
however, low abundance and unknown detectability make this difficult.  Therefore, we built a 2.4
ha enclosure, translocated 56 Texas tortoises into the enclosure, conducted weekly line
transects during morning, afternoon, and evening from July – September 2023, recorded
temperature and all tortoises observed, and calculated the percent of tortoises observed and
their detectability from the known number of tortoises within the enclosure. No differences
(F2,49 < 0.55, P > 0.57) were observed in number or percent of tortoises recorded, or
detectability between the 3 time periods.  Average detectability for Texas tortoises was 0.17.  An
inverse relationship, which was not affected (F2,46 = 0.97, P = 0.39) by time of day, was
detected between number of tortoises observed and temperature (F1,46 = 13.6, P = 0.0006).
Therefore, Texas tortoises could be surveyed anytime during diurnal hours, but it is
recommended to survey during the coolest time of the day in summer months.  Tortoises were
most active when temperatures were <29 C (85oF).",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
126,Prevalence and Treatment of Mycoplasma in Texas Tortoises,"The Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) is a threatened species in Texas whose
population numbers and distribution have declined. A potential mortality factor of tortoises is
upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), which is caused by bacterial species of the genus
Mycoplasma. The disease causes a range of symptoms including nasal discharge, swollen
eyelids, lethargy, and a general failure to thrive. Recent research suggests that these bacteria
have a commensal relationship with their tortoise hosts but that additional stress on tortoises
could alter their immune system, which can lead to infection. Our objectives were to collect
serum and whole blood samples from Texas tortoises located in the Rio Grande Valley (N =
171) and in coastal southern Texas (N = 23) to determine the prevalence of mycoplasma via
serology and PCR cultures, and to determine a protocol to treat mycoplasma symptoms in
exposed Texas tortoises. We tested the recommended dosages and administration of
tulathromycin and oxytetracycline, along with saline-injected symptomatic and healthy tortoises.
We found a 33% (64/194) prevalence rate for mycoplasma among tortoises with no difference
between areas of southern Texas.  Titers ranged from 1:32-128.  PCR was unable to detect
bacteria in any tortoise.  Neither antibiotic treatment improved the general health of symptomatic
tortoises; however, handling appeared to exacerbate mycoplasma symptoms in tortoises,
possibly to due to increased stress.  It is important to determine disease prevalence prior to
translocation efforts to avoid the undesirable consequence of introducing a disease to a novel
population.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
127,Linking Soil Moisture with Photosynthetic Activity with Very High-Resolution Imagery,"Water plays a vital role in the overall performance of native rangeland species. Water
stress due to drought causes stomata closure in plant species to minimize water loss and
reduce leaves' photosynthetic rate. Limited soil water can affect productivity and have an impact
on plant diversity. Limited water availability within plant species consequently has a negative
effect on plant diversity, and overall native plant health. Further, limited water availability can
result in lower forage quantity and quality, thus impacting domestic livestock and native wildlife
as they compete for available plant resources. Overgrazing inhibits the growth of palatable plant
species with high nutritional value which leads to stunted growth and plant stress. Plant stress
can be observed through remote sensing platforms. Our objective is to use multispectral
sensors on drones to monitor rangeland species and their spectral reflectance changes based
on water availability. We plan to fly drones 50 m above ground level and acquire multispectral
imagery for 3 species: Slender Grama (Bouteloua repens), Pink Pappusgrass (Pappophprum
Bicolor), and Seacoast Bluestem (Schizachyrium Littorale) at the Texas Native Seeds fields at
Texas A&M University- Kingsville during the 2024 growing season. Soil and leaf moisture
sensors will be used to compare field collected data and aerial imagery. Plant tissue samples
after each flight will help to determine the relationship between nutrient analysis and reflectance
values from hyperspectral imagery. This study will provide new insights on the relationship
between soil moisture, nutritional content, leaf moisture, and reflectance values of native
grasses in South Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
128,Exploring Temporal Variability in the Scale of Effect for a Declining Ground-Nesting Bird in an Anthropogenically Altered Landscape.,"In a rapidly changing and heterogenous world, organisms must often respond to
multiple pressures at different spatial and temporal scales. The scale of effect can represent the
scale at which a landscape variable has the strongest impact on the organism’s response, and
organisms are expected to have disparate responses to variables across different spatio-
temporal scales. In semi-arid systems, resources and conditions frequently change in
abundance, distribution, and severity based on, but not limited to, climatic patterns. Additionally,
these systems have increasingly become altered by anthropogenic activity that may functionally
alter the ecosystem. In South Texas, chestnut-bellied scaled quail (Callipepla squamata
castanogastris; hereafter: “quail”) populations have experienced distribution-wide population
declines in recent decades. These populations are also cyclical in nature where the population
will change dramatically annually in response to environmental factors. This large interannual
variability can make determining what is driving long-term population trends difficult. Therefore,
it is important to explore both population trends concurrently by exploring variation in the scale
of effect across multiple temporal scales. We will use 38-years of quail abundance data
collected from the Breeding Bird Survey and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s annual
quail surveys, along with landscape data from the Rangeland Analysis Platform to assess
variation in the scale of effect for landscape dynamics across a broad temporal extent (decades)
within fine temporal grains (interannual variation). Results will illustrate the spatiotemporal
dynamics of scale of effect within a landscape increasingly altered and fragmented by
anthropogenic activity for a culturally important gamebird.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
129,An Examination of Wildlife Characteristics Related to Risk of Entanglement in Mesh Products,"Road infrastructure is expanding across the United States, and these construction
projects typically involve a large volume of soil cut and fill. Contractors utilize erosion control
products (ECPs) to reduce soil erosion and improve plant growth. These products include mesh
erosion control blankets (ECBs) with the concern of potential entanglement to wildlife taxa;
however, few studies have focused on determining the level of risk ECPs pose to wildlife.
Specifically, few products have been evaluated for their risk of entangling wildlife. The objective
of this review was to determine the physical characteristics of wildlife and the properties of mesh
products that increase the likelihood of wildlife entanglement or mortality. We performed a
review of studies and accounts referencing wildlife entanglement or mortality in ECBs and other
mesh products. Previous studies and accounts have mainly involved snakes, followed by turtles,
and including a few reports involving amphibians, lizards, birds, and small mammals. Several
reports involved species listed as threatened or endangered. Body and limb size, mesh size and
inflexibility, and animal behaviors have been found to be potentially important factors in the
likelihood of entanglement. This review is part of a larger study that aims to provide the basis to
test and rank materials and identify effective, biodegradable ECPs that reduce entanglement
risk to wildlife.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
130,Estimating Waterfowl Density and Species Richness using Autonomous Recording Units,"Sanctuaries (i.e., non-hunted wetlands) are important for waterfowl during the hunting
season and have been shown to increase local waterfowl abundance and diversity. The Texas
Coast Waterfowl Sanctuary Program, created by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, strives
to enroll private wetland sites to serve as waterfowl sanctuaries in areas with high hunting
pressure. Traditional waterfowl survey techniques introduce potential biases and disturbance
due to observer presence. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) have become increasingly
common in avian research, but have not yet been used to estimate density of waterfowl. Our
objective is to develop a standardized protocol for estimating species richness and density of
waterfowl using ARUs for eventual comparisons between sanctuaries and hunted wetlands.
During phase 1, we performed playbacks along transects, recording climatic conditions and
broadcasting a sequence of vocalizations from 10 waterfowl species and pure tones at varying
distances from an ARU and human observer. Data collected from transects will be used to
quantify acoustic modulation in wetlands and allow for corrections to estimated waterfowl
density during future field deployment of ARUs. For phase 2, during winters ’23 and ‘24 we will
deploy 60 ARUs in paired sanctuary and hunted wetlands at public and privately-owned
properties along the Texas Midcoast. We will use BirdNET, a machine learning platform, to
create a classifier which we will evaluate for accuracy and use to process field recordings. Our
study will establish a protocol for passive acoustic monitoring of waterfowl in wetland
environments and inform strategic placement of sanctuaries in future years.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
131,Understanding Disease Transmission Dynamics in a Multi-felid System,"Wildlife disease mediated by the introduction of feral species can seriously impact
resident animal populations.   Understanding disease dynamics and potential spillover pathways
is important to safeguard populations of conservation value.  South Texas is the only location
where federally endangered ocelots (Leopardis pardalis) exist within the United States.  One
population exists in proximity to an urban area where feral domestic animals, specifically, cats
(Felis catus), are present, leaving ocelot populations exposed to potential disease spillovers.
Ocelots in South Texas are habitat specialists and live in Tamaulipan thornscrub, but spatially
overlap with bobcats (Lynx rufus), which are a generalist species that span urban and natural
landscapes.  This research will investigate the possibility that bobcats could spatially connect
ocelots to domestic cats, which may act as disease reservoirs.  Our focus is two-fold: (1) to
determine the directionality of disease transmission using genomic assessment of a common
feline virus (Feline Foamy Virus), and (2) to estimate contact rates of ocelots, bobcats, and
domestic cats and infer disease transmission risk.  We hypothesize that, due to known spatial
dynamics, bobcats  are the mediator species in disease transmission from feral cats to ocelots.
A greater understanding of disease dynamics among ocelots and sympatric species is crucial to
making management decisions relevant to ocelot recovery. Additionally, given the presence of
feral cats worldwide, understanding the role of feral cats in disease transmission has global
conservation implications.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
132,Investigating Patterns of Alligator Nest Site Selection and Nest Depredation by Wild Pigs,"Crocodilians worldwide are the subject of intense conservation efforts. Many species
have declined, and/or been rendered extirpated or extinct. Others have experienced notable
successes. The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is often thought of as a significant
example of successful crocodilian conservation and management practices. It is important to
continue to understand and monitor the species as threats of habitat loss and invasive species
are on the rise. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are one such invasive species that are a threat to
ecosystems, biodiversity, and native wildlife populations. Wild pig populations are expanding
across the United States. Depredation of alligator nests by wild pigs can negatively impact
alligators, yet the patterns of this depredation and the impacts on alligator reproductive success
are not understood. It is unknown how the probability of depredation by wild pigs varies in
relation to different habitat characteristics and selection of alligator nest sites. I will assess
habitat characteristics such as surrounding vegetation, distance to high human activity areas,
salinity, and soil type as well as whether the nest was built on a bank, levee, ditch, open marsh,
or island. Then I will assess if there is a correlation between the alligator nest habitat
characteristics and depredation by wild pigs.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
133,Are Native Grasses Pollinated by Insects?,"Pollinators play a vital role in all terrestrial ecosystems. We know from prior research
that they save the US economy an estimated 39.2 billion dollars every year by pollinating
agricultural crops and reducing the need for mechanical pollination. They also sustain
ecosystems by pollinating the vegetation, aiding in reproduction, which cannot be given a dollar
value. However, we do not yet know the extent of all the plant species they affect. This study is
aimed at filling information gaps regarding native grass pollination. We will be investigating the
relationships that insect pollinators may have with native grasses of southern Texas. We have
chosen to focus on ten native grass species which are widespread throughout the region and
have a variety of flowering structures. We are conducting this study at the Texas Native Seeds
facility in Kingsville, Texas. Plots of each focal species are established on bedded rows in
monotypic stands, and five individuals of each species were randomly chosen for observation.
We are recording the duration of available pollen resources the native grasses provide, and
which insects take advantage of these resources. Additionally, we are tracking the
morphological changes of the grasses’ inflorescences and determining whether various stages
of inflorescence attract insect pollinators. Field observations have shown that rainfall might have
a positive correlation to morphological changes and availability of pollen resources.
Understanding the relationships of pollinators with the native grass pollen resources will allow
us to better manage the native grasses to support them.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA

relevant issue due to the widespread use of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides
(SGAR) and the frequency in which these compounds are implicated in secondary poisoning of
raptor species. My study objectives are to determine owl species-specific densities, assess
nesting habitat associations, spatial distributions, and extent of overlap of owl species on the
Welder Wildlife Refuge and other areas. I will use passive audio monitoring (PAM) and call
playback methods to locate areas occupied by owls, then use ground searches for nest
locations and subsequent productivity monitoring, then conduct nesting habitat assessments
and extent of overlap of owl species. Additionally, I will assess prevalence of exposure by owls
to SGARs across protected and unprotected landscapes by collecting and comparing blood
samples from captured adult owls and those submitted to regional wildlife rehabilitation facilities.
By systematically collecting these combined data, a clearer understanding of the owl community
structure, resource partitioning, and productivity within the coastal bend region of Texas can be
obtained, along with an understanding of the distribution of occurrence and prevalence of SGAR
exposure across the landscapes.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
135,A Passive Integrated Transponder Tag Antenna Array for Tracking Small Mammals,"Although tracking technology has largely been miniaturized, size, weight, and battery
lifespan are still limitations with both radio and satellite telemetry for small animals. These
limitations can lead to poor spatial and temporal resolution of the data collected. To address
these limitations, we have developed a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag antenna array
to allow us to continuously track the movements of small mammals within a one-hectare area
with a 25-meter resolution, without the need for active data collection by a researcher. This PIT
tag antenna array will be used in a pilot study to monitor Ord’s kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii)
before deployment on the Texas kangaroo rat (D. elator). To address concerns on the spatial
resolution of our antenna array, we used the package SiMRiv in program R to simulate the
movement of 1,000 kangaroo rats within a random 1 ha landscape and compared the home
range size of the simulated true data and the data our PIT tag antenna array would have
collected. We conducted a two-tailed t-test on the home range sizes and found that our PIT tag
antenna array did significantly overestimate the size of the home range (0.12 ha) compared to
the true simulated home range size (0.08 ha; p < 2.2e-16). We are currently conducting field
trials with live animals and will report comparisons of real home range estimates of Ord’s
kangaroo rats using this PIT tag antenna array with our estimated home ranges with simulated
data.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
136,Comparative Analysis of Emerging Mayfly Diversity and Abundances and Their Role in Riparian Ecosystem Dynamics within the Upper Llano River Watershed: Implications for Rio Grande Wild Turkey Forage and Riverine Management Strategies,"The Upper Llano River Watershed in Texas, comprising the South and North Llano
Rivers (SLR and NLR) and their tributaries, is ecologically significant, yet faces challenges such
as drought, water withdrawals, invasive species, and declining riparian habitat quality. These
factors threaten the watershed and associated species, with possibly unequal impacts on the
NLR, which experiences intermittent dry periods, unlike the perrenial flows of the SLR. The
increasing frequency and intensity of water loss are particularly concerning for aquatic
invertebrates, including mayflies (Ephemeroptera), whose dynamic seasonal hatches may be
crucial nutrient sources for local species, including Rio Grande Wild Turkeys (RGWT; Meleagris
gallopavo intermedia). This study aims to compare the abundance and species composition of
mayflies between the two rivers as part of a broader investigation into total invertebrate forage
available for the RGWT.  We established two paired 40-meter transects at five sites, three on
the SRL and two on the NLR. One transect was positioned in proximity to the river channel in
the riparian area and the second randomly placed in a nearby riparian-upland corridor. Each
transect included three sticky traps, nine pitfall traps, and a 20-meter sweep net sample
collected every 13-15 days, April – August 2023. Understanding seasonal emergence patterns
of invertebrates across spatial and temporal scales can enhance our knowledge of river
community dynamics. This information can assist with adjusting management strategies that
maximize restoration ecology and will provide insight into the availability of ephemeral,
explosive food sources for Rio Grande Wild Turkeys during critical life stages.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
137,Insect Communities in Relation to Hydroperiod and Local Habitat in the Upper Llano River Watershed,"There is a current lack of data on the foraging habits and diets of Rio Grande Wild
Turkey (RGWT; Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) in the Edwards Plateau Ecoregion (EPE) of
Texas, where RGWT densities and harvest rates are the highest. Invertebrates are crucial for
RGWT nutrition and energetic needs during feather replacement and egg-laying, varying in
abundance across regions. Our goal is to investigate the invertebrate communities in riparian
and upland habitats of the Upper Llano River Watershed and evaluate available forage for
RGWT in context of seasonality and abundance of invertebrates and RGWT, respectively. We
established two 40-meter transects containing three sticky traps and nine pitfall traps at five
sampling sites, three on the South Llano River and two on the North Llano River. One transect
was positioned in proximity to the river channel in the riparian area and the second positioned at
approximately 50-100 meters from the riparian transect in a designated riparian-upland corridor.
At each transect we used a hand-net to collect 20-meter sweep net samples. Samples were
collected every 13-15 days, April – August 2023. We are in the process of compiling data
collected in 2023 to quantify and compare potential invertebrate forage for RGWT, including
identifying samples among all collection techniques and developing a preliminary community
matrix among season, sampling method, and transects. Our community-level data collected
among habitats, season, and methods will provide a background assessment of biodiversity
over time and space to compare to molecular data collected from RGWT fecal samples from a
concurrent study.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
138,Identifying Plant-Pollinator Networks Associated With Grasses in North-Texas,"Long-term studies show declines in global pollinator abundance and floral resources,
necessitating efforts to improve conservation for pollinator-plant relationships at local scales.
Likewise, grassland ecosystems have declined significantly in North America, leading to further
vulnerability of pollinator communities. Although primarily wind-pollinated, grasses provide
nesting structure and supplemental pollen when other floral resources are limited, particularly
during drought. We seek to examine plant-pollinator interactions associated with grasses during
early and late growing seasons to address the following objectives: (1) Quantify pollinator
networks associated with a suite of native, commercially available in working lands during
flowering periods in Texas, and (2) Assess pollen productivity and nutritive value at early and
late flowering stages. We developed a randomized strip plot design at Texas A&M AgriLife
Research and Extension Center in Stephenville, TX including five species of warm-season
grasses: silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroide), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), sideoats
grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and sand dropseed
(Sporobolus cryptandrus). We collected data on soil, pollen, flower visitors, and floral
characteristics. We monitored floral visitor activity through observational counts and vacuum
collections every two weeks during the flowering period in the mornings when temperatures
range between 10 and 33°C. We collected pollen at early and late flowering stages to assay
measuring content on amino acids, proteins, non-structural carbon, nitrogen, proximate and
fiber composition, fatty acids, and micronutrients.  We seek to provide a baseline for
understanding pollinator foraging interactions associated with grass and pollinator health and
guide conservation efforts in Texas grassland ecosystems.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
139,Greater Sandhill Crane Migratory and Population Connectivity as Indicated by Stable Isotopes and Microsatellites,"Greater Sandhill Cranes (Antigone canadensis tabida) in the Intermountain West are
currently managed as three separate populations: Central Valley Population (CVP), Rocky
Mountain Population (RMP), and Lower Colorado River Valley Population (LCRVP). Data from
>120 greater sandhill cranes equipped with platform terminal transmitters from CVP, RMP, and
LCRVP indicate significant overlap among summer, migrating, and wintering locations.
However, these data are limited by the geographic scale, price of transmitters, and other vital
financial and logistical constraints. The goal of this study is to use molecular techniques to
assess population overlap and migratory connectivity among the CVP, RMP, and LCRVP in the
Intermountain West. Our objectives include 1) assess population and genomic overlap and
connectivity using microsatellite markers, 2) assess if stable isotope signatures can be used to
identify locations where populations overlap, and 3) compare molecular data to geospatial data
collected from tagged greater sandhill cranes. We hypothesize 1) significant genetic overlap
exists among the CVP, RMP, and LCRVP in the Intermountain West and 2) population and
genetic connectivity is maintained by flooded agricultural fields and managed wetlands on public
and private lands. We collected the eighth secondary feather to extract microsatellites and
isotopes from twenty-five captured greater sandhill crane colts and 356 adults from the CVP,
RMP, and LCRVP, 2015-2023. Preliminary microsatellite data support our first hypothesis and
we are currently quantifying the magnitude and uncertainty of genetic overlap in addition to
completing objectives two and three.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
140,Assessing Prescribed Burns For Tick Control In Coastal Marsh And Prairie Ecoregion Of Southern Texas,"Tickborne diseases present a growing threat in the United States, impacting both
human and animal health. Methods to mitigate tickborne disease by controlling vectors in the
environment can be logistically challenging and financially unfeasible. Prescribed fire, which is
already utilized in many systems for vegetation management, presents a unique method to both
manage functionality of systems while also reducing vector burdens in the landscape. However,
its utility across different regions in the U.S. is questioned. Here, we assess the impact of
prescribed fire on tick densities in the Coastal Marsh and Prairies ecoregion in southern Texas.
We performed monthly surveillance using the drag method to sample across transects (750 m2)
and around the perimeter of tree mottes, which typically do not burn under prescribed fire
conditions due to insufficient fuel content. All tick species and life-stages (with the exception of
eggs) were collected during surveillance efforts. We demonstrate tick phenology in southern
Texas, with observed seasonal peaks among life stages (nymphs in late winter and spring,
larvae in late spring and summer; adults in fall). Further, we document that prescribed fire is
effective in reducing tick densities in rangelands where grass fuels are continuous. However,
woody mottes may provide environmental refugia for ticks to persist in the landscape, thus,
providing potentially infective ‘islands’ where vectors and reservoirs can converge.
Understanding effects of prescribed fire on tick densities in heterogenous landscapes that burn
unevenly is crucial for addressing specific management challenges posed by tickborne diseases
in the region.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
141,Changes in landscape structure after wildfire in South Texas,"Wildfires are an important natural disturbance and agent of change. Understanding
changes in vegetation communities post-wildfire is important when identifying recovery
pathways. In South Texas, USA, the Borrega Fire burned >21,000 ha in April 2022. Therefore,
our goal was to understand the landscape dynamics pre- and post-wildfire to provide insight into
rangeland recovery pathways. We used daily 3-m resolution satellite imagery and completed
supervised image classifications on one image per month to quantify spatiotemporal changes in
the vegetation distribution. Changes in four land cover classes were assessed: woody, non-
woody, bare ground, and burned (when able to identify charred areas). The March 2022 pre-fire
image consisted of 155 ha prescribed burned, 11,689 ha woody cover, 9,883 ha of non-woody,
and 234 ha bare ground. Immediately after the wildfire, woody cover decreased by 93.6% and
non-woody cover decreased by 69.5%. However, by March 2023, woody cover increased by
2.8% and non-woody decreased by 3.5% compared to pre-wildfire values. Additionally, we
compared Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values of four classes: woody
burned, woody non-burned, non-woody burned, and non-woody non-burned. We determined
the NDVI values of woody burned remained low due to top kill and herbaceous growth within the
understory. It is important to monitor fine-scale temporal changes that occur within vegetation
communities post-wildfire because landscape recovery begins immediately after a wildfire
event. Therefore, understanding recovery pathways is a key factor to implementing appropriate
management methods because results have shown no apparent negative influences on the
rangeland post-wildfire.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
142,Community Structure of Freshwater Turtles Along a Fishing Pressure Gradient,"Understanding the role of natural (e.g., habitat gradients) and anthropogenic (e.g.,
fishing pressure) factors that affect the structure of ecological communities is critical to the
development of conservation strategies. Turtles are amongst the most imperiled group of
organisms in the world which has been attributed to habitat loss, alteration, as well as
exploitation due to fishing pressure (both targeted and incidental). The goal of this project was
to quantify freshwater turtle community structure in the context of ecological (i.e., in-stream
habitat features) and anthropogenic (i.e., passive fishing gear) gradients. From June – October
2023, we surveyed for freshwater turtles at three study sites in east Texas: Alazan Bayou WMA
(unfished), the Attoyac River (fished), and Shawnee (unfished) for a total of 150 trap nights at
each site. We captured fewer turtles at both fished study sites (i.e., Attoyac and Shawnee),
compared to the unfished site (i.e., Alazan). Species composition at the Attoyac differed
significantly from Alazan (p = 0.024) and Shawnee (p = 0.006), however, Alazan and Shawnee
did not significantly differ from one another. We captured a greater number of turtles at locations
with a higher percentage of submerged woody debris and reduced canopy cover. Higher
surface water temperatures reduced turtle captures at the Attoyac and Shawnee study sites,
while increased turtle captures at Alazan. Both the presence of passive fishing gear and the
differences in habitat structure among our study sites appear to be contributing factors for the
dissimilarities in freshwater turtle assemblages.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
143,Investigating the Impacts of Sustainable Grazing Practices on Spiders in North- Central Texas Rangelands,"Arthropods play an important role in maintaining ecosystems integrity through many
services, such as pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control, and serving as prey items for other
species of wildlife. Rangelands, identified as grazing landscapes where native vegetation is
dominant, provide resources for arthropods, including spiders (Arachnida: Araneae), which
exhibit top-down control by regulating herbivorous insect prey populations. However,
overgrazing, pesticide use, and other unsustainable practices may impact the quality of habitat
for spider communities in rangeland ecosystems. The purpose of our study is to determine the
impact of grazing in North-Central Texas rangelands on spiders. Our objectives are 1) Quantify
changes in vegetation communities in rangelands under differing grazing pressures, 2)
Determine the relationship between grazing pressure, spiders, and their arthropod prey in Texas
rangelands, and 3) Identify the best range management practices to promote occupancy and
biodiversity of spider communities. We will establish 4, 0.4-ha fenced plots at Tarleton State
University’s Agriculture Center (Erath County) and Timberlake Biological Research Station (Mills
County) under rotational grazing (1.0 head AUM) with adjacent ungrazed plots for comparison.
We will sample vegetation using 1, 30-m transect via line-intercept method before and after
grazing to measure cover, density, and height for each species. We will sample arthropods
using a series of pitfall traps and vacuum sampling every 5-m and identify arthropods to lowest
taxonomic unit. We hope to guide management practices to improve biodiversity and
sustainability for spiders and other arthropods in Texas rangelands.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
144,Estimating Site-Specific and Region-Wide Density of an Endangered South Texas Felid Using Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture,"Accurate estimation of population size is critical to effectively manage endangered
species. One endangered species for which comprehensive abundance estimation is lacking is
the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), the only neotropical felid with extant populations in the United
States. While ocelots were once native throughout much of the state, habitat loss,
fragmentation, and harvest have restricted their range to two fragmented populations in South
Texas: the “ranch” population at East Foundation’s El Sauz Ranch, and the “refuge” population
at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge. To date, no comprehensive multi-site estimate of
abundance nor estimate of region-wide density has been achieved. Our research will 1)
compare the efficacy of spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) density estimation from
camera traps and scat dogs within the “ranch” and “refuge” populations, and 2) determine
relationships between ocelot density and landscape characteristics to extrapolate total density
across the South Texas region. We anticipate the use of scat detection dogs will provide higher
(and likely more accurate) density estimates than cameras but at a higher financial cost. We
also predict that ocelot abundance within South Texas may be higher than previously thought
when extrapolating to a regional scale. These findings will inform progress towards recovery
goals as stated in the Species Recovery Plan and serve as a baseline from which to evaluate
future population dynamics.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
145,Density and Habitat Use if Feral Pigs in Palo Pinto,"Invasive wildlife can have significant ecological impacts on native species and
ecosystems. They can outcompete native species for resources, alter habitats, and cause
population declines in other species. Understanding invasive species is critical to managing a
healthy and functioning ecosystem. Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species that cause
significant ecological and economic damage to native ecosystems in the United States. We aim
to determine feral pig density and habitat use within Palo Pinto Mountains State Park, Strawn,
Texas, a new state park set to open in 2024. We implemented a game camera survey
conducted from September to October 2023, which utilized over 400 trap nights. Our study used
20 randomized camera sites focused on riparian and forested habitat types. Each camera was
positioned 51 cm above the ground, with a minimum distance of 250 meters between them. Our
results will provide wildlife authorities with valuable insights to aid in their decision-making
process regarding managing and controlling feral pigs in the upcoming state park.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
146,Evaporative water loss and thermal preferences among three sympatric water snakes of the Brazos River drainage,"Climatic factors such as environmental temperatures and aridity are key determinants
of species distributions, and effective thermoregulation and desiccation tolerance are critical to
species-specific physiological performance. Despite its relevance, studies that assess
comparative physiological parameters remain limited for most groups. In the laboratory, we
investigated rates of evaporative water loss (EWL) and thermal preferences in sympatric
natricine snakes of the Brazos River, including the state-threatened Brazos water snake
(Nerodia harteri harteri), endemic to the middle stretches of the river system. Although results
are preliminary, we detected species-specific differences in both EWL and thermal preferences.
After controlling for mass, EWL was highest in the blotched water snake (N. erythrogaster) and
lower in both the diamond-backed water snake (N. rhombifer) and the Brazos water snake,
which were similar in their rates of EWL. In contrast, both blotched water snakes and diamond-
backed water snakes showed similar thermal preferences that were warmer on average than
those measured for Brazos water snakes Brazos water snakes, although individual variation in
measurements was high. Differences in these ecophysiological parameters are expected to
correspond to differences in habitat use and could shed light on present-day abundance and
distribution of Brazos water snakes, as well as inform future management priorities.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
147,A Range-Wide Hierarchical Abundance Model for Cagle’s Map Turtle,"Cagle’s map turtle (Graptemys caglei) is a small emydid turtle that is endemic to the
Guadalupe River drainage of south-central Texas and is currently listed as state-threatened.
Limited research on the population status of Cagle’s map turtle has been conducted in the
1990s and early 2000s, but with outdated statistical approaches, and current population
assessments are needed. Moreover, hierarchical modeling approaches allow for simultaneous
habitat assessment, providing additional insight into what, until now, has been considered
paradigmatic habitat use for the species (e.g., association with Black Willow [Salix nigra] and
avoidance of impoundments). The goal of our study is to evaluate distribution-wide abundance,
population structure, detection probability, and associated habitat characteristics of Cagle’s map
turtle using N-mixture models. Since June 2021, we performed multiple-pass count surveys of
turtles along 58 unique transects of the Guadalupe, Blanco, and San Marcos Rivers for an
approximate total of 764 river km surveyed. During the count surveys, we also collected
environmental variables as covariates to inform our models. The information gleaned from this
study will be valuable to wildlife management agencies, providing insight into the current
population status, habitat use, and potential threats to this drainage-restricted species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
148,Effect of Chinese Tallow on Amphibian Community Ecology and Species Interaction in East Texas Forest Ecosystems,"Amphibian decline is a global phenomenon, with several declines resulting from the
establishment of invasive species. Invasive plants, like Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera), can
alter chemical and physical habitat features, influencing decomposition and nutrient dynamics,
and modifying the trophic structure of invaded ecosystems, which can have detrimental effects
on amphibian populations. Much of the previous research focused on singular species effects,
primarily examining how Chinese tallow leaf litter influences amphibian life history
characteristics such as phenology, development, surfacing behavior, and survival. In essence,
these studies revealed that changes in water chemistry from decomposing Chinese tallow
leaves in aquatic settings effect various aspects of amphibian life history. Nonetheless, there is
a notable scarcity of research investigating the impact of Chinese tallow in east Texas regarding
its impact on amphibians and higher-level ecological occurrences such as community
assemblage and species interactions. To address this gap, mesocosm experiments will
investigate how environmental factors (Chinese tallow leaf fall timing, concentration, and
temperature) impact water chemistry, amphibian growth, survival, and extend to higher-level
ecological phenomena like predator-prey interactions, species competition, and community
formation. Predator and prey arrival times, prey and competitor species size will be manipulated
across various levels of the aforementioned environmental factors. These experiments will
provide insights into amphibian community ecology and species interactions in the presence of
Chinese tallow. Additionally, results from this study will help us understand the potential
ecological impacts of climate-induced shifts in amphibian breeding timing and tree phenology,
using East Texas species as model organisms.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
149,Erosion Control Products and Wildlife Entanglement,"Erosion control products (ECP) are used widely in transportation projects along
construction sites to retain soils during construction. These products are usually netting made
from plastic or natural materials that remain in the environment as vegetation regrowth occurs.
Entanglement of birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals in ECPs have been documented but little
research has been done to quantify the risk of ECPs to wildlife. We will assess how different
ECPs and the various stages of vegetation growth affect wildlife in a controlled experimental
environment. Our hypothesis is that the risk of ECPs will vary as the environment changes from
bare ground to denser vegetation. We will construct a wooden runway to measure wildlife
response to ECPs and simulate vegetation at various levels of growth and density through
placement of road whiskers in combination of ECP types.  We will designate 5 species as
candidates for study and monitor animal behavior as the individual moves across the ECP and
through the whiskers. We will measure behavioral responses to the ECP (e.g., avoidance,
digging below or moving above), and the time it takes to move from one end to another as proxy
for impediment to movement. This study is part of a larger project which aims to increase
understanding the risk of ECPs to wildlife in Texas and improve restoration efforts where
anthropogenic disturbances influence wildlife-habitat relationships.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
150,Informing Recovery: Current Genetic Status of Isolated Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) Populations in South Texas,"Captive breeding and reintroduction programs have saved numerous wildlife species
from extinction but rely on the availability of suitable stocks that are adapted to the local
environment. For the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), reintroduction efforts may be needed for this
species to persist in the northern limit of its current distribution. [RWD1] There are an estimated
< 100 individuals left in the United States in 2 isolated populations. The populations are stable
but threatened by genetic drift, inbreeding, and stochastic events such as hurricanes. Suitable
stocks for reintroduction exist in northern Mexico, but population monitoring efforts in the region
are limited by concerns for human safety. Thus, captive breeding and reintroduction of the
species to expand their range and introduce genetic variation has become an option for their
conservation. To facilitate reintroduction efforts, we will index genetic diversity in captive and
wild populations. Additionally, we aim to assess population divergence between zoo-sourced
and wild ocelots to aid captive breeding pair selection. We are analyzing genetic data collected
from free-ranging ocelots in South Texas during 1991-2023 and zoo-sourced ocelot samples
sourced from 25 zoos (with likely geographic origins of Brazil and North and Central America).
We will use low-coverage whole genome sequencing to assess historical changes in population
size, levels of inbreeding, and population structure.  Preliminary results indicate that the two wild
populations have low genetic diversity with limited gene flow amongst them. These wild
populations may benefit from the introduction of new alleles from captive populations sourced
from diverse geographic locations.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
151,An Assessment of Fine Scale Microclimate Conditions in Purple Martin Artificial Housing and its Influence on Productivity,"Aerial insectivores are experiencing significant long-term population declines
throughout their ranges. The eastern subspecies of Purple Martin (Progne subis subis) is
particularly vulnerable as they are almost entirely dependent on provisioned artificial nesting
cavities. The decline in Purple Martin populations emphasizes the importance of provisioned
housing for the eastern subspecies and is crucial to the long-term conservation of the species.
Our goal is to better understand the influence of microclimate (defined as temperature and
relative humidity conditions inside artificial cavities) on egg and chick survival across the range
of the eastern Purple Martin among six different artificial housing types and 14 study areas
across the eastern United States. Our objectives to reach our goal are: 1) assess microclimate
among six unique house types without the presence of nests or birds and, 2) five–seven
randomly selected artificial houses with active nests at each site, 3) compare internal
microclimate conditions to external, ambient conditions within objectives 1 and 2, 4) conduct
weekly nest status checks per Purple Martin Conservation Association’s Project MartinWatch
Citizen Science protocols. We collected approximately 1.9 million and 2.1 million temperature
and relative humidity readings for objectives 1 and 2, respectively, March-August 2023.
Preliminary analyses are in progress, and we will collect these data again in 2024. Our findings
will enhance our understanding of Purple Martin artificial housing options and provide
quantitative data to maximize nest survival for this declining species across its entire
distribution.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA

understanding health, behavior, movement, and other factors crucial to optimum management.
Knowledge of available feedstuffs within specific ecosites can provide a better understanding of
necessary management practices, such as food plot additions and nutrient supplementation to
support healthy populations. On a ranch near Cross Plains, TX, we are determining the quantity
of browsable species within the edge of individual motts, as well as assessing browse diversity
and quantity across ecosites. Additionally, we are working to estimate available browse
produced by each species across seasons. To determine browse availability in 5 pastures,
motts with browsable understory were mapped and circumference (m) of each mott was
measured using ARC GIS. Random points were assigned to mott edges relative to mott
proportions in each pasture. Thirty meter transects were stretched along the edge of motts at
each random point and browsable plants along the transect were identified to species and
tallied. Data were analyzed by ecosite to determine species diversity, density of individuals per
species, and percentage of mott edge each species was estimated to occupy. In fall 2023, the
Tight Sandy Loam 26-33"" PZ ecosite had the most species present, with an average of 9 per
transect. Quercus virginiana and Ulmus alata had the greatest quantity within species, though
Celtis sp. were present in over 62 percent of transects. Continuation of this research will better
support determination of browse quantities within ecosites and provide insight into habitat
selection and utilization.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
153,When Nature Calls: Acoustical Measures of Biodiversity and Naturalness in an Urban/Peri-Urban Landscape,"Recently, there has been much interest in using bioacoustics as a indicator of
anthropic influence on urban green spaces to assess biodiversity/species richness within
anthropic landscapes. This is because bioacoustics monitoring may be a very cost effective
means to index the presence or vocal species on a landscape, or to determine the level of
human impactedness of a landscape.  We surveyed 7 urban sites in and around Denton Texas,
a small – midsized city in northeast Texas. At each site we placed a wildlife acoustics micro
acoustic data logger for 5 to 7 days.  Loggers were programmed to record for five minutes of
every hour during that time. We then used the soundecology package from R programming to
analyze the acoustic data to identify high frequency sounds likely to be associated with
anthropic activities, and low frequency sounds typical of natural noise. We also evaluated bird
species richness using Merlin Bird ID app at each site.  Bird species richness varied from 12-16
per site and generally was higher at sites with less higher frequency (technophoinc) noise
spectrum. Preliminary acoustic analysis of one of the sites already shows anthropogenic
influence with higher average acoustic evenness score (AEVE= 0.58) and low average
Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI= -0.089). While not surprising, these results do
support the notion that we can use bioacoustics to evaluate the degree of human impactedness
of urban greenspaces. This may prove to be a valuable tool for conservation and management
of wildlife on anthropic landscapes.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
154,Assessment of Parasitism and Associated Pathogen Prevalence in Free-Ranging Felid Populations in Southern Texas,"Parasites have varying physiological effects on their hosts including reduced nutrient
absorption, decreased blood cell activity, and damage to host tissues. The impact of parasite
burden can be compounded by other internal (e.g., genetic inbreeding) and external (e.g.,
environmental) factors. In southern Texas, two wild felids coexist: ocelots (Leopardus pardalis)
and bobcats (Lynx rufus). Ocelots are endangered in the United States, and the remnant
populations exhibit low levels of genetic diversity, while bobcats are more common across this
region. Our objectives for this ongoing study are to determine parasite and pathogen prevalence
of free-ranging ocelots and bobcats by evaluating endoparasite loads, ectoparasite use, and
pathogen presence.  Fecal flotation for identification of endoparasites was conducted on 48
felids (ocelots, n=17; bobcats, n=31) spanning four years (2019-2022).  The most common
intestinal parasites were Toxascaris leonina (roundworm) and Ancylostoma spp. (hookworm).
Ectoparasites were identified from 69 felids (ocelots, n=26; bobcats, n=43) spanning 35 years
(1985-1986, 2010-2012, 2019-2022).  The most common ectoparasites were ticks
(Dermacentor variabilis) and fleas (Pulex spp).  Pathogen presence in the ectoparasites will be
compared to pathogen presence detected in the host to provide insight surrounding
transmission rates.  Moving forward, ectoparasite and associated pathogen identification will be
completed on additional species (coyote, white-tailed deer, and nilgai) in the study area to
investigate ectoparasite host preference and community pathogen transmission factors.  These
findings provide a better understanding of the felid population’s susceptibility to parasitism and
assist in planning strategies that aid in reducing or preventing transmission of parasites and
infectious disease agents.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
155,"Evaluating the Effects of Grazing Practices on Forage Production, Nutrition, Diversity, and Soil Moisture in the Marfa Grasslands, Texas","Grasslands comprise 20 to 40% of the world’s surface and provide ecosystem
services, such as water retention and purification, directly harvested goods, and carbon
sequestration. However, grasslands are one of the most rapidly declining ecosystems in the
world. Throughout the Anglo-American colonization in Texas during the 1800s, desert
grasslands of the Trans-Pecos were subjected to livestock overgrazing and other improper
agricultural practices. With increasing wildlife conservation values and extensive historic
livestock operations, livestock grazing can enhance wildlife habitat and attain economic
benefits. Rotational and continuous grazing systems modify rangelands and provide income for
ranching operations. This project aims to identify and compare grass species abundance,
annual forage mass production, accompanied soil moisture, and forage nutrition between a
long-term rotational, continuous, and deferred grazing system in a desert grassland of the
Trans-Pecos. Grasses were collected at the end of the 2023 growing season. Random stratified
sampling was used to place 270 0.5 m2 plots in all grazing regimes but confined to two soil
types (Marfa-clay-loam, and Musquiz-clay-loam). Volumetric soil moisture was taken at each
plot with all other floristic data. We expect higher species diversity in the rotational pasture while
more coverage by specific dominant species in the continuous pasture. We expect higher
forage mass production in the rotational system depending on adequate prior precipitation. The
results of this project will allow for grazing to be better used as a management tool to conserve
and restore grasslands.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
156,New and Old Technologies for Soil Erosion Control: Using Remote Sensing to Monitor the Effectiveness of Trincheras,"Soil erosion is a widespread problem that leads to habitat degradation and topsoil
loss. Understanding this process is essential for restoring rangeland communities and targeting
efficient management strategies. With recent advancements in remote sensing technology,
UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are capable of efficiently collecting large amounts of data
while minimizing input and observation costs that help monitor landscape changes over time.
This project aims to monitor the effectiveness of trincheras (i.e., rock filter dams) at retaining
topsoil. We will do this by constructing 3D models of drainage channels using UAV acquired
imagery. We will capture oblique angle images taken from multiple perspectives of the channel
and then use them to construct a 3D model using the SFM (Structure from Motion) technique.
Image sensor, flight altitude, and image overlap can contribute to variability in resolution of the
3D models. We will assess different combinations of flight altitude, image overlap, and camera
sensors to maximize the resolution and assess geomorphic changes over time. After a desired
framework process is developed, we will use the heights from the 3D models to monitor
sediment accumulation from the trincheras. This process can give us a volume of soil
accumulated at trinchera locations and guide management on where to place erosion control
structures to maximize efficiency of topsoil retention.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
157,Wattles for Water: Comparing Five Restoration Treatments for a Severely Degraded Rangeland in the Northern Chihuahuan Desert,"Semiarid ecosystems make up over one-third of the earth's land surface. These
landscapes provide habitat for various flora and fauna and provide important ecosystem
services. However, decades of excessive livestock grazing and extended periods of drought
have transformed many of these systems into brush-dominated landscapes incapable of
performing their historic functions. Such concern drives recovery efforts in the northern
Chihuahuan Desert, where water is the key limiting factor for restoration. Most of the region's
precipitation (>70%) is returned to the atmosphere through transpiration or evaporation. The
remainder leaves the origin site through runoff and overland flow or remains in place through
soil infiltration. Increasing infiltration rates and volume can help increase vegetation germination
in these hot desert shrubland systems. This project aimed to compare five hydrology
improvement treatments placed on a three-hectare test site within a 60-hectare area grubbed
for woody brush in south Brewster County, Texas. All five treatments are based on the
emplacement of biodegradable wattles perpendicular to the land's slope. After one year of
precipitation, results indicate that wattle placement in areas of increased water potential
produced a 35% or greater increase in plant ground cover. Furthermore, decreased soil
temperature along wattles with shade cover produced 25% or more plant production than similar
wattle treatments without shade. This suggests that strategic placement of wattles in areas of
greater water concentration, especially when combined with loose grubbed brush cover
shading, can produce plant ground cover percentages that provide a foundation for restoration
on degraded hot desert sites.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
158,Prevalence and Behavioral Impacts of Toxoplasmosis in Southern Texas White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus),"Toxoplasmosis (causative agent Toxoplasma gondii) is a zoonotic disease that
causes significant morbidity in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Felids are definitive
hosts for T. gondii but most warm-blooded species are susceptible and infection is chronic. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized T. gondii as a leading cause of
death due to foodborne illness in the United States, and classifies toxoplasmosis as a neglected
parasitic infection. Infection has been documented to change host behavior, including loss of
fear, increased aggression, and risk-taking. Human disease has been linked to consumption of
infected wildlife products (e.g., venison), however prevalence data are sparse for free-ranging
game species. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are an ecologically and economically
important species and have been identified as an intermediate host for T. gondii. Therefore,
understanding the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in deer populations has implications for human
health. The objectives of this project are to: 1) assess the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in four
distinct white-tailed deer populations in southern Texas, and 2) investigate the effects of
infection on the behavior of white-tailed deer. This study will leverage ten years of biological
samples and four years of movement data to address stated objectives. Banked serum will be
screened for antibodies using a modified agglutination test and movement data will be used to
identify behavioral discrepancies between infection statuses. Understanding the prevalence of
T. gondii in game species is important for assessing human risk, particularly in southern Texas
where many rural communities reside at the wildland-urban interface.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
159,Examining Population Dynamics and Spatial Ecology of a Declining Population of Pronghorn in the Southern Great Plains,"Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are an ecologically, culturally, and economically
important big game species that historically maintained huntable population levels in Oklahoma.
Recent surveys, however, indicate the population has been declining for more than a decade.
Pronghorn in Oklahoma are limited to the Panhandle region, an area characterized by variable
weather and resource availability, increasing anthropogenic development, and changing
agricultural practices. We developed a comprehensive 5-year research project beginning in
2022, which aims to assess factors influencing population dynamics and to provide
management recommendations to reverse declines. We have captured and GPS collared 147
adult pronghorn, with additional plans to deploy >100 collars over the next two years. We
monitored adult females using movement clustering algorithms and visual observations to
detect parturition events and collared 70 neonates. We monitored collars to assess vital rates
and cause-specific mortality. We collected pronghorn fecal samples to assess the role of diet
quality and parasite loads. We also conducted predator scat surveys to evaluate the relative
occurrence of pronghorn in predator diets and to generate indices of predator abundance. We
will examine the spatial ecology of pronghorn, specifically evaluating resource selection and
interstate movement. This research will be used to develop an integrated population model to
estimate population growth rates and will inform for population monitoring, habitat management,
and harvest strategies for pronghorn in the southern Great Plains.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
160,A Comparison of Survey Methods for the Calculation of the Bird Friendliness Index,"To address the decline of grassland birds in the Great Plains region of the United
States, the Audubon Society has established the Conservation Ranching Incentive (CRI) for
landowners to promote land management practices that benefit native grassland communities.
One tool to assess the efficacy of this program is the Bird Friendliness Index (BFI), which
considers bird densities, conservation status, and ecosystem function to provide a numerical
score to determine a property’s capacity to sustain diverse and resilient grassland bird
populations. This research aims to compare BFI scores between CRI enrolled and non-enrolled
properties, to compare methods of collecting bird count data for BFI calculation, and to
determine whether amendments are needed in BFI methodology to better suit the Arid
Southwest region. During the spring of 2023, six properties with varying grazing practices, land
use, and CRI membership status were surveyed. A total of 228 individual point counts in 9 16-
point plots yielded 3,348 total observations of 57 species. Although not a complete reflection of
grassland health and function, initial analyses of α biodiversity metrics suggest that CRI
enrollment status was not a predictor of richness or Shannon’s diversity within these sites, with
an intensely grazed, non-enrolled site possessing higher values (S = 32, H = 2.9) than all but
one CRI enrolled site. While statistical significance cannot yet be determined due to small
sample size and high inter-site variability, future monitoring and analysis will allow for a
thorough comparison of BFI scores between sites and efficiency of different count
methodologies.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
161,Guiding Wildlife: Evaluating Wildlife Exit Designs and Sensor Lights for Safer Highways in South Texas,"Globally, road networks have been expanding rapidly and are expected to increase
further in the coming years. Roads benefit humans when moving to and from distant places,
saving time and money. However, the same linear infrastructure can act as a physical barrier to
wildlife movement and result in habitat fragmentation. To alleviate the effects of roads on wildlife
in south Texas, wildlife underpasses, wildlife guards (WG), and exclusionary fencing were
deployed by TxDOT to prevent wildlife road mortalities. However, fences can sometimes act as
a barrier for wildlife stranded within the Right-of-Way (ROW). To address this, TxDOT installed
ten wildlife exits (WEs), to allow wildlife to escape the ROW, and sensor triggered lights (STLs)
on 13 WGs, to prevent animals from crossing the WG at night. The objectives of this research
were to compare the wildlife use of a modified WE design with previous designs and to assess
the effectiveness of STLs in deterring wildlife from using WGs. Reconyx trail cameras were
used to monitor each WE and WG for a year. Images were downloaded every two weeks, then
sorted by species and interaction. A comparison of successful wildlife use of WE between the
designs will be made using ANOVA. The number of refusals by wildlife to enter the road at WG
before and after installing the STLs at WGs will also be analyzed with ANOVA. If successful,
these novel and cost-effective designs can be replicated on highways with fences worldwide,
reducing the rate of wildlife-vehicle collisions.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
162,Avian Community Response to Removal of Encroaching Woody Vegetation in Trans- Pecos Grasslands,"The grasslands of North America are one of the fastest declining habitat types on the
continent. This is due to a variety of reasons, including energy conversion, livestock grazing,
and woody plant encroachment. As a result of this habitat loss, grassland-obligate bird species
are in steep decline across the continent. An estimated 88% of migratory grassland birds
overwinter in the Chihuahuan Desert. Woody plant encroachment within the Chihuahuan Desert
has decreased available grasses, leading to a reduction in winter food availability and nocturnal
thermal cover. Encroached woody vegetation also provides more habitat and perching
opportunities for avian predator species, such as loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) and
American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Grassland restoration efforts typically involve brush
removal using herbicide, mechanical removal, and fire. In the Trans-Pecos, we will study sites
within the Marathon and Marfa grasslands where herbicide and mechanical removal have been
used on mesquite varieties (Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var. glandulosa and Prosopis glandulosa
Torr. var. torreyana), creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), and tarbush (Flourensia venus). We will
be conducting non-breeding bird surveys and vegetation surveys across a control site, a site 4
years post herbicide treatment, and a site that used mechanical removal 4 years after having
been treated with herbicide. Our results will help inform broad-scale restoration that will
hopefully result in increases for species currently listed as Species of Greatest Conservation
Need.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
163,Restoration of Native Vegetation in Areas Invaded by Lehmann´s Love Grass,"Native and non-native grassland species interact and compete for space and
resources. Sometimes, those negative interactions can affect native species by leading them to
eradication and converting a rangeland into monocultures. This is due to non-native species
having aggressive behavior and better response than natives towards drought and wildfires.
Also, some non-native plant species are not preferred by wildlife. For example, scaled quail
(Callipepla squamata) habitat is indirectly affected by negative interactions with invasive species
such as Lehmann Lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana). Therefore, we initiated a restoration
project to mitigate Lehmann Lovegrass monocultures and increase native plants for scaled
quail. This project was located in Southern Brewster County and is part of the Chihuahua
Desert. Our goal is to evaluate ways to decrease and control Lehmann Lovegrass. Therefore,
we established 200 plots, 16 m2 each, with 4 treatments. Treatments are soil disturbance,
native plant seeding, soil disturbance and seeding, and a Control. We used 3 line intersections
in each plot. We implemented treatments during the summer of 2022, Data was taken in the
post-rainy season in October 2022, the winter season in February 2023, and is going to be
measured by two years. Data already collected was treated with a RDA to find relationships
between treatments and species,  preliminary results indicate that in bouth seasons, LLG is still
present, but seeding, and soil disturbance and seeding treatments have more relation with
natives plant species and LLG is more related with controls. While soil disturbance treatment
have a negative relation with LLG.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
164,Livestock Tanks for Migratory and Wintering Grassland Birds in the Trans-Pecos,"Many grassland bird species are undergoing steep population declines, including
many birds that winter in the Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. Overwintering birds in this region
have declined by 70%. However, there is little data on habitat preferences and resource
utilization for many grassland bird species during migration and winter. In the arid landscape of
the Chihuahuan Desert, livestock tanks may be an important water source for birds, and
potentially an important food source as well for birds that feed on invertebrates in moist soils.
Our study will document which migrating and wintering birds utilize livestock tanks, and what
characteristics of livestock tanks relate to bird diversity and abundance. We are using
automated recording units (ARUs) and point-count surveys at dirt livestock tanks to determine
bird species presence, abundance, and behavior. Characteristics sampled at each tank include
soil invertebrates and environmental characteristics such as shrub density and soil moisture.
Early surveys have documented 35 species of birds actively using the tanks and engaging in a
variety of behaviors. The variety of birds utilizing the tanks has included raptors, shorebirds,
warblers, sparrows, flycatchers, and ducks. Tanks with and without water can both provide
appealing habitat to birds, as moist soils within dry tanks lead to plant growth that differs from
the surrounding grassland and to soil invertebrate foraging opportunities. Knowing more about
how birds use livestock tanks as a resource can help inform management decisions to conserve
imperiled bird populations, especially on private rangelands.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
165,"Movement Ecology, Dispersal, and Genetic Relatedness of Mountain Lions (Puma concolor), in South Texas and Mexico","Barriers to movement have complex and widespread influences on population
dynamics. Anthropogenic barriers like fencing can impede wildlife movements and fragment
populations, thereby, eroding genetic diversity, lowering species fitness measures, and
increasing a population's extirpation risk. To date, there has been little empirical research to
examine if and how the border barrier system separating the United States and Mexico affects
the movement ecology, genetic connectivity, and population viability of large mammals. Our
project helps fill this research gap by using movement ecology and population genetics to
elucidate barrier-induced ecological and demographic consequences on mountain lions (Puma
concolor), an apex carnivore able to disperse long distances, and generally requiring large,
unfragmented areas of habitat. Our research will investigate mountain lion space use at fine and
broad scales, determining the relative importance of maintaining robust Mexican mountain lion
populations and transboundary movements of Mexican mountain lions into Texas, for genetic
exchange and persistence of viable mountain lion populations in south Texas. Specifically, we
will (1) use movement data from GPS collars to evaluate landscape permeability for mountain
lions, and (2) use DNA samples from captured mountain lions and historical samples from
individuals in Texas and Mexico to describe the genetic relatedness and structure of mountain
lions in the borderland region through time. Evaluation of dispersal corridors and genetic
structure in the context of the border barrier system will assess the sustainability of mountain
lion populations in south Texas, while informing possible statewide and bi-national management
and mitigation needs of this transboundary carnivore.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
166,Concrete Jungles and Carnivorous Residents: A Multifaceted Exploration of Mesocarnivore Dynamics in Urban Greenspaces,"Habitat fragmentation is a challenge for most wildlife, but specifically for medium to
large mammals as they are more vulnerable to alterations in physical and biological traits as a
result of habitat loss and isolation. As landscape connectivity is essential for urban carnivores
for movement and dispersal behavior, it is expected that with decreasing connectivity, less
functional linkages and higher human presence, carnivores’ persistence and survivability will
waver within urban matrices. Denton, TX is a model study site for landscape composition as it
has both isolated and natural habitat patches with diverse urban wildlife. The goal of my study is
to assess the role of landscape connectivity to maintain a functional metapopulation dynamic of
mammal diversity in urban greenspaces. This study used primarily camera-trapping using
SECR analysis for bobcat (Lynx rufus) and coyote (Canis latrans)density with covariate data of
small-mammal trapping for abundance, camera-traps for mesocarnivore occupancy, and
vegetation indices for tree diversity and habitat naturalness. Preliminary results demonstrate
high density of bobcats within isolated patches while coyotes’ density is higher in greenspace
corridors. Additionally, small-mammal trapping may suggest low prey density of white-footed
mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) within natural patches.
Over the next year, remaining field data will be analyzed for least cost paths, potential corridors,
and habitat patch comparison to aid in urban wildlife ecology and conservation for the City of
Denton.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
167,Demographic Analyses Suggests Lewisville Population of Painted Buntings is a Demographic Sink,"The Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris) is considered a “species of conservation
concern” by the US Fish and Wildlife Service due to persistent population declines, and the
Breeding Bird Survey notes that the species has declined 56% in Texas from 1966-2022. We
collected demographic data from a seven year mark-recapture study on painted buntings in
Lewisville, TX (2017-2023). We used a Matrix Projection Model to model population dynamics
and then conducted retrospective and prospective analysis on the demographic data to
determine the influence of the different vital rates on the finite rate of population change.
Juvenile survival (SJA=0.09), adult survival (SA=0.41), and fecundity (FA=0.51) were low. The
population was projected to decline (λ=0.502), however, count data over the seven year period
has shown the population steadily increasing, which suggests that the painted bunting
population in Lewisville may be an ecological sink supported primarily by immigration. The
results of the retrospective analysis indicated that the finite rate of population change was most
sensitive to adult and juvenile survivorship, while the results of the prospective analysis
indicated that management focused on adult survival would have the greatest benefits on
mitigating population declines.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
168,Evaluating Wildlife Diversity Responses to Pine Plantation Age Structure Using a Multi-taxa Survey,"The Southern U.S. accounts for over half of the timber production in the country,
generating over 54 billion dollars of income annually. Forest plantations in the Southeastern
U.S. are predominantly composed of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). As pine trees are continually
being planted and harvested, this cycle creates a mosaic of stands made up of different cohorts.
This mosaic provides a diversity of habitats and therefore contributes to a dynamic
recolonization of wildlife species. Our research will use a multi-taxa approach to sample insect
floral visitors, herpetofauna, avifauna, and mammalian fauna within loblolly pine plantations to
determine differences in wildlife assemblages among stand ages (cohorts). We will utilize the
following equipment for our sampling techniques: blue vane traps, coverboards, automated
recording units (ARUs), and camera traps. These items will be used across 12 sites containing
young (2-6 years old) and mature (18-22 years old) pine stands, i.e., a paired-plot sampling
design. We expect young pine stands to have greater species richness levels for insect floral
visitors and reptiles, while mature pine stands will have greater species richness levels for birds,
mammals, and amphibians. Results from our study will improve our understanding of the
influence and dynamics of pine forest age structure on wildlife species in Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
169,Space Use of Sympatric Aoudad and Mule Deer in the Trans-Pecos,"The ecology of Aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) in Texas is poorly understood, where the
introduced African species coexist and potentially interact with the native mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus). Aoudad space-use, daily activity cycles, and social dynamics are largely unknown in
the Trans-Pecos region of Texas. However, they are important relative to their potential impact
on mule deer and desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) recovery in the region. With
improved quantitative techniques in movement ecology, aoudad space-use can be readily
assessed using the Brownian bridges movement model, calculated using collar data. No
literature has quantified aoudad utilization distributions using the BBMM or examined the
influence of aerial gunning relative to changes in movement behavior. In April 2023, 40 aoudad
and 40 mule deer were captured and collared in the Chinati and Quitman Mountain ranges.
Collars record the animal’s location via satellite at 2-hour fixes. To date, utilization distributions
for both aoudad and mule deer have been calculated for each collared individual. Results
demonstrate aoudad on average range over wider areas (58.04 km2 in the Quitmans and 23.99
km2 in the Chinatis) compared to mule deer average space-use (3.30 km2 in the Quitmans and
3.87 km2 in the Chinatis). Utilization distribution overlap between species was calculated using
the Bhattacharyya’s Affinity (BA) niche overlap metric, resulting in a 58.5% overlap in the
Quitmans and 40.6% in the Chinatis. Comparing pre- and post-aerial gunning movement
behavior will prove valuable in understanding aoudad movement spatially and temporally, for
future development in native big game recovery.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
170,Species-Specific Patterns of Consumption of Oral Rabies Vaccine Baits in the South Texas Plains,"Oral Rabies Vaccine (ORV) baits have been aerially dropped along the US-Mexico
border since 1995 for canine rabies. However, there is little information on the fate of baits once
they are deployed across the landscape. Our goal is to determine which species are consuming
the ORV baits in the South Texas Plains. We used ArcGIS to generate eight 1 km2 grids with 18
camera trap sites in each grid. We hand applied one ORV bait per camera trap at two grids
during each application trip. We collected camera data from 144 different sites for four
consecutive weeks during each of the four calendar seasons on the East Foundation’s San
Antonio Viejo Ranch. We will determine species-specific consumption of ORV baits, and how
other factors, such as season may affect consumption patterns. We will generate competing a
set of competing models and use Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to determine which model
best explains specific-specific patterns of bait use among those considered. We will evaluate
how temperature, season, and species impacts ORV bait consumption. We will then check the
likelihood of our top models. We predict that species and season will affect ORV bait
consumption. The results from this study will help better inform ORV management practices for
future ORV aerial drops.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2024,NA
171,"Movement Patterns, Home Range, and Microhabitat Use of Alligator Snapping Turtles in a Small East Texas Stream","The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii), the largest freshwater turtle in
North America, faces numerous threats, with population declines and range contractions
suspected to have occurred across the historic range of the species. Most studies on movement
patterns and microhabitat use of M. temminckii have been conducted in large, open, lentic
environments and few studies have been conducted in small, lotic habitats. We investigated the
movement and microhabitat use of adult female and juvenile M. temminckii within Bonaldo
Creek, a small tributary of the Angelina River in eastern Texas. Six M. temminckii were
monitored (2-3 relocations per week) via radiotelemetry from July 2008 to September 2009. We
found that the linear home range for adult females (1395.5 – 405.1 m) was higher than that of
the unsexed juveniles (996.9 – 439.7 m), although movement frequency was similar between
groups. Juveniles utilized a smaller subset of microhabitats compared to adult females. Adult
females utilized microhabitats with abundant submerged structure, while overhanging
vegetation was an important microhabitat feature for juveniles. The broader microhabitat use we
observed in adult females may have been influenced by seasonal factors, highlighting the need
for more long-term, seasonal assessments of M. temminckii movement and microhabitat. Such
investigations will bolster our understanding of the spatial and temporal factors that influence M.
temminckii populations in different systems.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
172,Activity patterns of a reintroduced population of Louisiana Pinesnakes across multiple temporal scales,"Knowledge of an organism’s phenology can inform monitoring efforts by maximizing
detections during surveys, especially when time and effort is limited. Conservation efforts for the
Louisiana Pinesnake (Pituophis ruthveni), a federally threatened species, include a
reintroduction program with the release of captive reared snakes. Since 2010, snakes (N = 408)
have been released annually on the Catahoula Ranger District of the Kisatchie National Forest
of Louisiana. Individuals were marked with a PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tag prior to
their release on the reintroduction site where they were monitored with automated PIT tag
readers (APTRs) and box traps. Through this large scale and intensive monitoring effort, we
sought to quantify the daily and monthly activity patterns of Louisiana pinesnakes. Snake
activity was highest in May, and decreased, but remained consistent, during the summer
months (June – September). APTRs revealed the daily activity patterns of snakes with the
greatest activity occurring between from 1100 – 1800 h with a peak of activity between 1200 –
1300 h. These data will assist decision makers in determining when to monitor for these snakes
if/when resources are limited. These results can also be used to help guide a standardized

173,King Ranch Bluestem Expansion on Small Prairies in Southeastern Texas from 2012 to 2023,"Many small and isolated prairies occur on the Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF)
in southeastern Texas as disjunct extensions of the southern portion of the larger blackland
prairie ecoregion to the west. King Ranch (KR) bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum), an invasive
grass native to Eurasia and North Africa, has been planted in Texas by ranchers as forage and
by the highway department along roadsides. From there it has been unintentionally spread to
other areas. KR bluestem is now well established on many SHNF prairies where it aggressively
competes for space with native prairie vegetation, drastically altering the plant composition at
some sites by creating dense, homogeneous stands over time. In 2012, we measured the total
area of six prairies (mean = 2.1 ha) and the total area within each prairie dominated (≥50%) by
KR bluestem. In 2023, we again measured the area dominated by KR bluestem within the same
prairies. We compared 2012 and 2023 measurements to determine the extent of KR bluestem
expansion during the eleven-year interim. The mean percent area dominated by KR bluestem in
2012 and 2023 was 7.8% and 19.7%, respectively. This translates to a 150% increase in area
dominated by KR bluestem from 2012 to 2023 on the six prairies. The transition from a native
prairie plant assemblage to dense expanses of KR bluestem may negatively affect certain
vertebrate communities. There is evidence suggesting that rodents and some species of
overwintering sparrows in these prairies tend to avoid larger areas of dense KR bluestem.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
174,Piping Plover Winter Site Fidelity Along the Upper Texas Coast,"The Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) is federally listed as threatened in the United
States, and is considered endangered within the Great Lakes region and Canada due to habitat
loss, human disturbance, and climate change. While breeding status is well known, the
wintering populations of this species are not well understood. As a direct result of banding
efforts of United States Geological Survey, Virginia Tech, Nebraska Game and Fish
Commission, and other organizations, we were able to determine origin and age of the banded
individuals we observed during long-term winter surveys. To evaluate site fidelity, we chose four
flagged Piping Plover at random from all flagged plovers (N = 63) seen at least once at
Matagorda Peninsula along the Upper Texas Coast from fall 2018 through spring 2023. We
determined distance between known breeding (capture) location and first observed winter
detection at the site. After initial observation, each flagged plover was observed multiple times
throughout the non-breeding season along the peninsula. We determined the ages of the
observed Piping Plover ranged from 5 to 12 years and average distance traveled during annual
migration was 3,167 kilometers. By looking at the origin of each Piping Plover, we noted that all
four individuals originated from the Great Plains Region (North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado,
and Nebraska) and are from threatened populations. With each individual seen yearly for four
consecutive seasons within the same location, continued monitoring and conservation efforts
are necessary to maintain this important wintering habitat for this, and other, imperiled species.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
175,"Effects of Range Management on the Plateau Spot-tailed Earless Lizard, Year 2 Results","The plateau spot-tailed earless lizard (Holbrookia lacerata) is currently under review
for federal listing. Its range includes the semi-desert grasslands of the Edwards Plateau in
Central Texas, across which apparent population declines have been observed. On a
microhabitat scale, previous research has shown that H. lacerata is most often encountered on
bare ground and less frequently in dense or brushy vegetation. Our research objective is to
better understand which rangeland management practices cultivate microhabitat landscapes
preferred by H. lacerata. Our second year of surveys have concluded at the Texas A&M AgriLife
Research Station at Sonora in Edwards County. The Sonora Station has researched long-term
control, grazing, and fire management treatments for decades, providing a well-documented
landscape that focuses on rangeland practices already implemented in this region. A diverse
habitat mosaic may be preferable to our target species and rangeland practices such these are
regularly used to control patches of woody vegetation and encourage such landscapes. For H.
lacerata detection surveys we use a stratified random sampling design with forty 0.8-ha circular
survey plots across four treatments: control, graze, burn, and burn and graze. In year two we
also began vegetation surveys with a sampling design derived from the point-centered quarter
method, as well as H. lacerata tracking. Preliminary results show that individuals were found
primarily in grazed (n=10), burned (n=7), or burned and grazed plots (n=5), with only one
individual caught in the control plots. We will continue to survey H. lacerata and collect habitat
data in 2024.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
176,Camera-Trap Basking Arrays Detect Western Chicken Turtles in Dynamic Ephemeral Wetland Mosaics,"Temperature and precipitation vary regionally, seasonally, and annually creating
different constellations of ephemeral wetlands over time. Species occupying ephemeral
wetlands must track these dynamics as the location, size, shape, permanence, density, and
spatial conﬁguration of suitable habitat shifts. Such species can be difficult to sample, especially
when methods involve intensive trapping. Semiaquatic freshwater turtles, in particular, can be
difficult to study with traditional trapping techniques, because individuals track shifting suitable
habitat via far-ranging terrestrial movements throughout large, dynamic ephemeral wetland
complexes. Here, we develop and assess the efficacy of an inexpensive camera-trap basking
array designed to move up and down with the changing water levels of ephemeral wetlands
occupied by Western Chicken Turtles, a subspecies under review for listing under the U.S.
Endangered Species Act. At a study site in Texas, we deployed one camera-trap basking array
at four different wetlands, all known to have chicken turtles present. The camera-trap basking
array was effective at detecting Western Chicken Turtles at three of the four wetlands during the
study. On-going research is focusing on understanding the causes of this variation in detection
across all four wetlands. The simple, durable design and low cost (<$500, US) of this camera-
trap basking array provides opportunities to scale up surveys for the species range-wide and to

177,A Collaborative Approach to Managing and Recovering Wild Houston Toad Populations,"Houston Toads (Anaxyrus houstonensis) have been federally listed as endangered
under the Endangered Species Act since 1970 due to a multitude of factors contributing to the
loss and alteration of this species’ native habitat. Currently, there is a multipronged collaborative
effort involving federal, state, and local agencies working on a Houston Toad management and
recovery program. The prongs of this program include protecting and restoring habitat,
propagating and supplementing individuals into the wild, establishing a monitoring program, and
educating the public through outreach programs. As a part of this recovery program, the Natural
Resources Institute has been tasked with monitoring and surveying for wild chorusing Houston
Toad populations in Robertson and Leon Counties, TX. To detect chorusing Houston Toads, we
established 20 roadside auditory survey points in each county based on historical records and
results from habitat models. To supplement the driving surveys, we also deployed 20 automatic
recording devices (ARDs) on private lands throughout these counties. In total, we conducted
33.4 hours of roadside auditory surveys and the ARDs collected approximately 3247.1 hours of
recordings between 6 January 2023 and 14 July 2023. The surveys were unsuccessful in
detecting wild chorusing Houston Toads, but we did detect the presence of 12 anuran species
calling during this survey period. Here, we present our preliminary results and future work
towards managing and recovering wild Houston Toad populations in Robertson and Leon
Counties, TX.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
178,Using Automated Recording Units to Examine the Calling Behavior of the American Woodcock in Eastern Texas,"The American woodcock (Scolopax minor) is found in forested habitats across
eastern North America, with eastern Texas representing the southwestern most part of their
breeding range. The woodcock has a unique breeding display which starts with “peent” calls
and continues with a spiraling flight that can extend upwards to 350 feet off the ground. We
implemented a sampling protocol to determine if automated recording units (ARUs) were
suitable for detecting American woodcock, and if so, examine the calling behavior of the
American woodcock in eastern Texas, specifically on the Sam Houston National Forest. We
detected American woodcock at 19 of the 20 sites we sampled from 20 January through 5
March 2023. Detections included four sound types: “peent” call, display flight, “cackle” call and
fly overs. Peent calls and display flights, which represent breeding behavior, were detected at
16 of 20 sites sampled. Woodcocks called as early as one minute after sunset but, on average,
calling began 15 minutes after sunset and these vocalizations continued for an average of 20
minutes per night. Although our ARUs were not deployed in time to determine the date of first
calling in 2023, the last vocalization of the season was detected on 5 March 2023. In our study,
American woodcock were detected at nearly all our survey sites suggesting that the species
was common and widespread across the Sam Houston National Forest in 2023. We conclude
that ARUs are very effective at detecting calling and flight displays associated with American
woodcock breeding activity.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
179,Marine Debris and Public Outreach: a Dashboard is Worth a Thousand Words,"Though marine debris is a known danger to coastal ecosystems and wildlife,
resolving the litter problem requires changing the attitude of the public and inspiring care for the
environment.SPLASh (Stopping Plastic Pollution Along Shorelines- a litter cleanup group based
in the Houston-Galveston region) connects people to wildlife via programming that specifically
targets litter in bird habitats. SPLASh runs litter cleanups with the support of volunteers,
collecting and documenting litter using a specific methodology (STOP), creating reliable and
consistent data. This data is then added to the Texas Litter Database, a statewide repository of
publicly available litter data. SPLASh requested an online visual representation of their project
progress, using metrics from their litter cleanups.  While presenting scientific data in a friendly,
engaging manner can be challenging, the use of maps, landmarks and attention-grabbing
graphics can help citizens recognize issues impacting their communities. Dashboards can be a
major asset to the web presence of an organization, especially if metrics are important for any
funding or outreach efforts. To create a solution for SPLASh, we imported cleanup data to
design a versatile and flexible solution that combined ArcGIS Storymaps and Dashboards for
their project.  These dashboards seamlessly import data directly from database downloads
allowing the system to be easily used by non-GIS professionals, allowing SPLASh to maintain
the system independently with little to no assistance.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
180,How Do Ethnicity and Gender Affect Students Choosing Careers in Wildlife?,"Ethnic and gender diversity are commonly sought after by universities and employers
alike.  While we agree this is a worthy goal, we questioned whether factors outside the control of
universities and employing organizations influenced students’ selection of careers, which
resulted in skewed diversity within the field of wildlife science.  We compared ethnic and gender
composition of the general population (US, Texas, and southern Texas) from the US Census
Bureau to declared majors at a Hispanic-serving institution in southern Texas (Texas A&M
University-Kingsville; TAMUK) in 2010, 2015, and 2021.  We found that the percent of Hispanics
enrolled in a Rangeland and Wildlife Sciences Department (RWSC) was substantially less
(51.7%) than the Hispanic population at TAMUK (68.5%), and female Hispanics comprised only
16% (N=26) of RWSC students.  Only <1% and 0% of African Americans and Asians,
respectively, were enrolled in RWSC at TAMUK.  We conducted an informal survey of TAMUK
students (N = 146) to better understand what factors influenced their career choice.  The
majority of Hispanic females (79%; 34 of 43) stated they were taught as children that women
became teachers or nurses.  Asian students (N = 5) said they received parental influence to
enter careers similar to their parents, either in medicine, engineering, or finance.  Only
Caucasian students (N = 24) believed their career choice was their own to decide.  If
universities and institutions desire diversity, programs designed to increase diversity in the
workforce must start early and include outreach to parents.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
181,A GEM in the Rough? The Grasslands Effectiveness Monitoring (GEM) Protocol as An Integrated and Tiered Approach to Grassland Habitat Treatment Assessment,"There have been successful voluntary conservation programs, such as the Grassland
Restoration Incentive Program (GRIP) and the USFWS Partners, that assist private landowners
with restoring critically declining grassland habitat in Texas (98% privately owned). The success
of these restoration and conservation programs are insightful and have slowed grassland
habitat degradation and loss. However, few monitoring protocols exist that scientifically evaluate
the extent to which habitat is successfully restored and if best management practices were
used. Therefore, members of the USFWS, USGS, Oaks and Prairies Joint Venture, Texas
Parks and Wildlife, and Rio Grande Joint Venture developed the Grassland Effectiveness
Monitoring (GEM) protocols which are modified from the Bureau of Land Management
Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) strategy, and are compatible with data collected
by the Natural Resources Conservation Service National Resource Inventory rangeland on-site
survey. Thus, GEM is a statistically robust, user-friendly option to assess the effectiveness of
best management practices used in restoring grassland habitat. After two years of pilot field
work, GEM is proving to be scientifically sound in its ability to detect changes in vegetation
structure post-management. GEM allows users to choose between three different tiered
approaches, with each protocol having varying levels of complexity, catering to expertise level,
monitoring goals, budget, and project timelines. Therefore, by creating a standardized protocol
that can be widely used in grassland restoration across North America, we may be better
prepared to understand how management practices are influencing restoration efforts.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
182,Movement and Habitat Selection of Repatriated and Wild Alligator Snapping Turtles in Eastern Texas,"The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is the largest freshwater turtle
in North America. Although M. temminckii occur in a variety of riverine habitats, they possess a
life history characterized by high juvenile mortality and longer maturation periods. Therefore,
illegal harvest or bycatch may exacerbate local population declines. Knowledge of their spatial
ecology in the wild is limited, and few translocation studies are known. Here, we investigated the
movement and habitat use (i.e., macro- and microhabitat selection) of repatriated and wild M.
temminckii to explore the feasibility of repatriation efforts. Repatriated and wild turtles, fitted with
VHF radios, were monitored weekly from September 2022 to September 2023. We calculated
home ranges using 95% Auto-correlated Kernel Density Estimates (AKDE), and investigated
movement over time with Generalized Additive Models (GAM). Incorporating a hierarchal
approach, we quantified macrohabitat availability and collected a suite of microhabitat variables
at M. temminckii locations and paired random points. We observed sex-specific differences in
home range size in both groups, and found repatriated female home ranges less contiguous
compared to wild females. Seasonal movement responses were similar between groups, but
repatriated turtle movements were exacerbated compared to wild turtles. We found repatriated
turtles utilized more riverine macrohabitat and wild turtles utilized mostly wetlands and oxbows.
However, we found no difference in microhabitat selection between groups. Our results suggest
key aspects of M. temminckii ecology can be affected when introduced into novel environments,
and this may impact the long-term ability to acquire resources over time and survive.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2024,NA
1,Species Richness and Genetic Diversity: Continental Patterns of Bird Diversity Correlations Across the United States,"Abstract: Species richness (SR) and genetic diversity (GD) are fundamental aspects of biodiversity. Each plays a unique role in maintaining ecosystem stability. Literature suggests that species richness and genetic diversity may be spatially correlated and co- vary at different scales. However, research on SR×GD correlations remains equivocal. Some studies find positive correlations between SR and GD, whereas others report negative or no correlation. Understanding relationships between SR and GD is fundamental to elucidating the complex dynamics of biodiversity maintenance considering ongoing climate change and anthropogenic land use intensification. Using data synthesis and meta-analysis, we explored spatial correlations between bird SR and GD among species across the continental United States. Using Bird Banding Station (BBS) data, we estimated species richness, rarity weighted richness, and Shannon’s diversity across >3,800 BBS routes from 2013 to 2022. We then used spatial statistics in ArcGIS to identify regional hotspots in bird SR. Next, we performed a detailed meta- analysis of published literature across approximately 200 papers for estimates of bird GD. We estimated hotspots of GD using the published accounts of bird GD with mapped sample locations. Using Multiple Response Permutation Procedure, we found that several areas of bird GD significantly overlapped areas of bird SR. Geographically Weighted Regression analysis identified areas where bird SR significantly predicts bird GD, which were concentrated along coastal areas of the eastern US. These areas may be critical targets for protection, as they seem to be areas that support diversity across multiple scales important to maintaining the future adaptive potential of wildlife.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2025,NA
2,Using Apple Airtags to Track Urban Raptors,"Abstract: Accurate tracking of the movement of wildlife is important for understanding the behavior, spatial use, and resource selection of a species. We evaluated the effectiveness of Apple Airtags, a Bluetooth tracking device that can be purchased for US $22.50-$29.00, for tracking Harris's Hawks in the Rio Grande Valley, Texas. We tagged eleven urban hawks with Airtags, and we have been tracking their movements for over 9 mo. Airtags have yielded 1,448 locations (approximately 132 locations per hawk) with all Airtag data being collected remotely at a cost of $0.25 per location. We recorded juvenile dispersal and exploratory movements for all six juveniles tagged, and one adult dispersal. Average juvenile exploratory foray distance was 9.65 km (range: 2- 50.05) and the adult dispersed 48.8 km. We also analyzed home range using the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method. For the ten Harris’s Hawks equipped with Airtags that provided sufficient data for analysis (>25 locations), we estimated a 95% KDE home range of 389.4 ha for five adults and 133.5 ha on average for nine juvenile natal and dispersal territories. Core 50% KDE home ranges yielded an adult range of 47.7 ha and juvenile ranges averaging 40.3 ha. We conclude that Apple Airtags can be used for tracking urban wildlife, allowing analysis of home range areas and spatial use patterns. Despite limitations such as reliance on proximity to Apple devices and finite battery life, Airtags offer a low-cost alternative for researchers working with medium-sized and large species in areas with human activity.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2025,NA
3,Addressing Assumptions of Nonlethal Monitoring of Microplastic Contamination in Nestling House Sparrows,"Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging pollutant with growing concern for their effect on wildlife health; however, songbirds remain understudied. As many songbirds are experiencing declines across the U.S., nonlethal methods of evaluating MP contamination warrant consideration. We conducted a study on house sparrows (Passer domesticus) from 3 study sites in Stephenville, Texas, Fargo, North Dakota, and Easton, Pennsylvania in 2023 and 2024. Our objectives were to evaluate the use of fecal sacs for MPs as an alternative to lethal methods and to address two potential assumptions for studies using fecal sacs, those being variation in MPs across nestling development and variation within broods. We collected fecal samples and GI tracts from nestlings aged 10 days. To examine assumptions, we collected fecal samples from the same nestlings at age 4 days and 10 days, and we collected fecal samples from all nestlings in broods with ≥3 nestlings. We processed all samples to chemical digestion using 30% H2O2, vacuum filtration, and examination under a stereomicroscope. We found that 74.1% of fecal samples contained MPs (n = 321) and all GI tracts samples contained MPs (n = 16), but they were not correlated. We found little difference in contamination across development. We conducted an intra-class correlation test (repeatability score; R package rptR) and determined that variation within brood is high (R = 0.151, P = 0.036). This study on house sparrows, a model species, informs future MP research and provides a broader insight into the abundance of MPs in songbirds.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2025,NA
4,"Conflict, Conservation, and Coexistence: Texans’ Views on Mountain Lions","Abstract: Large carnivores like mountain lions (Puma concolor) often evoke intense emotions due to their involvement in livestock predation, human attacks, and generating fear. Managing these predators is particularly challenging due to diverse stakeholder interests in wildlife conservation. While mountain lions are classified as ""least concern"" by the IUCN, their population status varies regionally. Texas, which hosts an estimated 7% of the U.S. mountain lion population, may overestimate numbers due to their nongame status, unregulated harvesting, and high mortality rates, raising conservation concerns. To address these challenges, a Qualtrics survey of 1,069 Texans assessed their knowledge, attitudes, and preferences toward mountain lion management. Participants included hunters, livestock producers, and urban and rural residents. Results showed 43% viewed mountain lions as rare but not endangered in Texas, while 31% correctly identified them as nongame animals without hunting restrictions. Over half (52%) had heard of mountain lion-human interactions; 27% reported personal sightings, and 22% noted household encounters. Livestock like sheep, goats, deer, and cattle were seen as most at risk. Respondents agreed mountain lions are vital to ecosystems (mean score: 4.0) and expressed support for their survival (3.93), with moderate endorsement for protection (3.63), monitoring (3.70), and management planning (3.61). Lethal control was supported after attacks on humans (41%), pets (37%), or livestock (33%), with hunters and producers favoring aggressive responses. Rural residents generally supported stronger actions than urban residents. These findings emphasize the need for inclusive policies to balance conservation and coexistence with mountain lions.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2025,NA
5,Population Structure of Alligator Snapping Turtles Along a Fishing Pressure Gradient,"Abstract: Passive fishing gear (e.g., trotlines, limblines, juglines) is a prominent threat to the alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii). However, this threat has yet to be quantified in Texas. Our goal was to quantify the density and persistence of passive fishing gear in east Texas streams, as well as to quantify demographic parameters of M. temminckii in sites that vary in passive fishing pressure. We surveyed for passive fishing gear and M. temminckii at three east Texas sites: Alazan Bayou Wildlife Management Area (unfished), Attoyac River (fished), and Shawnee (fished) from June 2023–August 2024. We found a total of 84 passive fishing devices at Attoyac and 67 at Shawnee, with 92.9% and 83.6% appearing abandoned, respectively. No devices had legal gear tags. Seasonal density estimates of passive fishing gear were highest in Fall 2023 but declined by Summer 2024. Detection probabilities of passive fishing gear decreased with time, river discharge, and gage height but increased with precipitation. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of M. temminckii from hoop nets and acoustic receivers was highest at Alazan, compared to Attoyac and Shawnee. The demographic structure of M. temminckii at Alazan, unlike Attoyac and Shawnee, appears to be similar to that of robust M. temminckii populations (e.g., higher proportion of adults than juveniles, near equal sex ratio). Given the potential impacts of passive fishing gear on M. temminckii populations, management efforts should prioritize the removal of these abandoned devices, especially during periods of low river discharge and gage height.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2025,NA
6,Migratory Patterns of the Orange-crowned Warbler Wintering in Central Mexico and southern United States,"Abstract: Migration is a crucial strategy for many avian species, allowing them to access optimal resources despite significant energy costs and predation risk. The Orange-crowned Warbler (Leiothlypis celata) is a small migratory songbird that breeds across Canada and western United States. This species is known to migrate southward for the winter, with large populations wintering in Central Mexico and the southern United States. However, little is known about the geographic origins of these wintering populations, as multiple breeding populations may converge on these shared wintering grounds. We investigated the migratory connectivity of the Orange-crowned Warblers using hydrogen stable isotope (δ²H) extracted from feathers of individuals captured at wintering sites in Mexico and the southern United States. We implemented a Bayesian approach to identify individual geographic origins, revealing diverse breeding grounds across the northern region of North America. Additionally, we used morphometric measurements, including mass, wing chord, and tail length from long-term banding data from the Lower Rio Grande Valley in south Texas to confirm the subspecies. The morphometric data suggest that two subspecies, L.c.celata and L.c.orestera utilize this region during winter, with L. c. celata being more prevalent. These findings provide key insights into the timing, distribution, and winter behavior of Orange-crowned Warblers, improving our understanding of their migratory patterns and their response to environmental change.",oral,Cottam Awards Competition,2025,NA
7,Plasticity and Peril: Niche Adaptations of Desert Bighorn Sheep Facing Competition and Disease,"Abstract: Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) co-occur with invasive aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) in Trans-Pecos, Texas. Research has demonstrated that aoudad and desert bighorn niches overlap in optimal habitat, raising concern about disease transmission risk and potential for competition. It is essential to understand how desert bighorn niches may shift in the face of competition, particularly as we seek to manage populations in a disease landscape. I explored variation in niche breadth, position and configuration among seven desert bighorn populations and 12 population years in the Trans-Pecos to determine whether desert bighorn exhibit niche plasticity. The populations had significant variation in niche size, the difference in niche volume between the largest and smallest niche (BGWMA and BBRSP respectively) was log(D) = 19.64. BBRSP:Diablos had the smallest distance between niche centroids (MD =0.51), the farthest distance between centroids was EMWMA:Diablos (MD = 5.23). Niche dissimilarity was greatest between EMWMA:Diablos (BD =11.42) and smallest between BBRSP:Diablos (BD = 1.44). BGWMA individuals had the greatest average distance from the population centroid (MD, m = 4.86, σ = 4.52), and Diablos the smallest (MD, m = 4.37, σ = 2.10). Individuals with greater distance from their population centroid had a higher risk of death (b = 0.209, p = 0.0000443). These results suggest constrained potential for desert bighorn to respond to aoudad competition via niche shifting and provide a framework for predicting how niche partitioning may result in shifts in desert bighorn sheep geographic distributions, social structure, and consequent changes in disease risk.

8,Spatial Interactions of Axis and White-tailed Deer in the Edwards Plateau Ecoregion of Texas,"Abstract: Axis deer (Axis axis) are a free-ranging, exotic species of ungulate in Texas with a similar ecological niche as native white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Axis deer, which are considered livestock rather than game animals, persist on private lands in Texas primarily because of their year-round hunting value which generates significant economic benefits for landowners. The co-occurrence of axis and white-tailed deer may lead to competition for resources. Increasing abundance in free-ranging populations of axis deer poses ecological concerns regarding dietary overlap, habitat degradation, and displacement of native species. White-tailed deer, which contribute billions of dollars annually to the Texas economy through hunting and management activities, are particularly vulnerable to competition for forage and space availability. This study aims to quantify the spatial and temporal interactions between axis and white-tailed deer using data collected by GPS Iridium collars attached to 15 white-tailed deer and 10 axis deer on a private property (3415.03 ha) located in the Edwards Plateau ecoregion. We will assess the home range, habitat preferences, and spatial overlap between the two species using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Resource Selection Function (RSF) modeling to evaluate competition between the species. Our findings will guide management decisions to mitigate competition between the species and help balance economic interests with conservation goals.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals I,2025,NA
9,Seasonal Dynamics of Browse Nutritive Value in the Southern Cross Timbers and Prairies of Texas,"Abstract: In the Southern Cross Timbers and Prairies Region of Texas, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are a recreationally and economically valuable resource. As selective browsers, white-tailed deer consume diets with greater forage value than the surrounding vegetation. During winter and drought periods, browse can become the primary food source, but nutritive value and availability varies among and within growing seasons and years. To better understand browse nutritive value year-round, browse samples were collected bimonthly from a ranch located near Cross Plains, TX starting in May 2023. Browse samples of six different species (chittamwood, elbowbush, winged elm, post oak, live oak, and skunkbush) were collected from two different ecological sites, loamy bottomland, and clay loam. Nutritional constituents of browse samples were determined, including crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, and protein precipitable phenolics (PPP). Ruminal digestibility was estimated using in vitro true digestibility methodology (IVTD). Both IVTD and crude protein had a significant month effect (P < 0.01). Browse IVTD differed during periods of growth and dormancy with the greatest digestibility and least fibrous constituents in the spring and summer. Additionally, the three species with the highest concentrations of PPP, skunkbush, live oak, and post oak, were also assessed to determine the effect of varying PEG inclusion rates on IVTD. Results indicated a trend of increased digestibility with the addition of PEG, particularly for fibrous components. This could be due to seasonal alteration in carbohydrate form and availability and/or the effect of PPP on the associated rumen microbiome.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals I,2025,NA
10,Competition With Wild Pigs Alters Predator-Prey Dynamics Between Coyotes and White-tailed Deer,"Abstract: Predator-prey dynamics are shaped by numerous factors, including the distribution of resources and interactions with other species. Behaviors exhibited by prey to reduce interactions with competitors can influence the probability of encountering their predators. Invasive species can have substantial impacts on native food web dynamics, often altering species’ behavior and disrupting established predator-prey relationships. We examined how competition with invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) influenced white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) behavior, and subsequently interactions with coyotes (Canis latrans). During July – August 2024, we conducted an experiment in eastern Texas using passive and baited camera surveys to quantify how deer modified their diel activity in response to competition with pigs at areas with concentrated resources. At passive sites, without concentrated resources, deer-pig temporal overlap was high (Δ=0.896, CI=0.860 - 0.934). However, at baited sites with pig activity, deer decreased nocturnality and increased diurnal activity, resulting in lower temporal overlap with pigs (Δ=0.639, CI=0.559 - 0.718). This behavioral flexibility allowed deer to capitalize on important resources while minimizing competition. This response also had cascading effects on predator-prey interactions, potentially lowering predation risk for deer. Deer-coyote temporal overlap was significantly lower at baited sites with pig activity (Δ=0.474, CI=0.397 - 0.550) than at sites without pig activity (Δ=0.680, CI=0.571 - 0.788). Our findings suggest the behavior used to minimize competition also lowered predation risk; however, increased diurnal activity likely induced thermoregulatory costs. More broadly, our work demonstrates that prey behaviors induced by competition with invasive species can disrupt native predator-prey dynamics.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals I,2025,NA
11,Should I Stay or Should I Go: Behavioral Plasticity Breeds Success in Dynamic Environments,"Abstract: Adaptive decision-making allows individuals to maximize performance in the face of environmental uncertainty by leveraging past experience to inform behavior. We evaluated whether previous experience influenced maternal behavior and reproductive success. From 2020 to 2023, we captured pregnant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and equipped them with vaginal implant transmitters to track parturition events and collar neonates at birth sites. We monitored neonates daily until a mortality event occurred and considered females reproductively successful if they had at least one neonate survive the first 14 days of life (i.e., limited mobility period where neonates employ a “hider strategy”). We quantified site fidelity as the Euclidean distance between birth sites of the same individual in consecutive years. We identified 29 consecutive birth site pairs from 21 individuals. We used linear mixed effects models to examine the effect of recent success on site fidelity in the subsequent fawning season. We then used a Cox proportional-hazards model to identify site fidelity’s effect on neonate survival. We found that recent success significantly influenced site fidelity. Specifically, females who were unsuccessful in the previous fawning season selected a birth site approximately 0.23 km farther from their previous birth site, suggesting females employed a “win-stay: lose-switch” strategy in site fidelity. Additionally, site fidelity significantly affected reproductive success in that females who moved farther from their previous birth site experienced a 61% reduction in neonate mortality risk. Our results suggest that females learned from experience and adapted their behavior to promote success in the future.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals I,2025,NA
12,Identifying Drivers of Radio-linked Neonate Collar Performance,"Abstract: Monitoring neonatal survival is critical for understanding population dynamics. However, traditional tracking methods pose logistical challenges that hinder neonate monitoring. Integrating ultra high frequency radio chipsets into global positioning system collars that monitor paired very high frequency units has improved neonatal monitoring capabilities, enabling practitioners to explore novel questions. Framing these questions requires an accurate characterization of what constitutes an adult-neonate contact and the factors that influence connection success. We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models to examine the influence of terrain ruggedness, vegetation structure, collar height, and adult-neonate collar distance on collar connection success in a shortgrass prairie during Jul−Aug of 2024. The odds of connection decreased with increasing terrain ruggedness (β: −0.79, SE: 0.07, p < 0.001) and greater collar distance (β: −0.04, SE: 0.002, p < 0.001). The negative effect of collar distance was stronger at greater terrain ruggedness. At a terrain ruggedness (i.e., mean difference in elevation between a focal and neighboring cells in m) of 0, probability of connection was >0.97 across all distances tested (20–185 m). However, at a terrain ruggedness of 5.8, probability decreased to 0.50 at ~100 m. We did not detect an effect of vegetation structure or collar height. Our results highlight how terrain ruggedness influences proximity estimates. We also provide some of the first estimates of the distances at which adult and neonate collars can connect, showing that successful connections simply indicate the adult is within 100 m or more, complicating reliable identification of true adult- neonate contacts.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals I,2025,NA
13,Understanding Drivers of Recruitment of White-tailed Deer in South Texas,"Abstract: Rangelands are often managed for cattle production and wildlife. Understanding the effects of cattle on wildlife relative to other factors, such as precipitation, is key to effective multiuse management. We experimentally manipulated cattle management on East Foundation’s San Antonio Veijo Ranch in South Texas where white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are not exposed to harvest or supplemental feed. We measured recruitment indices using evidence of lactation in autumn from 284 adult female deer captured from 2011-2023 and known fate survival to 12-weeks of 90 neonates monitored during 2020-2023. We characterized capture locations of adult females and birth sites of neonates based on landscape attributes, precipitation, and cattle management. We fit generalized linear mixed models predicting the lactation status (yes or no) as a function of these covariates. We fit Cox-proportional hazards models to predict mortality hazard of neonates as a function of the same predictors. We found the presence of cattle during the fawning season (June-August) reduced the probability of lactation in adult females and increased the odds of neonate mortality. We also found both recruitment indices increased strongly with spring rain and moderately with brush density. Our results demonstrate a benefit of the rotational grazing treatment, such that deer recruitment improved where cattle were absent during the fawning season. While rainfall patterns strongly influenced recruitment, manageable factors including cattle grazing and brush density offer potential approaches to manipulate deer recruitment. Our results highlight the utility of managing these factors to achieve deer recruitment objectives.

14,"The Value of Pricklypear and Diverse, Native-plant Communities as Nesting Habitat for Scaled Quail","Abstract: Habitat loss has been implicated in the decline of chestnut-bellied scaled quail (Callipepla squamata castanogastris) in southern Texas. Although a general affinity of the subspecies for native thornscrub is known, little information exists on its specific habitat requirements and demography. We conducted a study (n = 5 ranches; LaSalle and McMullen counties) to 1) quantify survival, reproduction, and occupancy of chestnut-bellied scaled quail and 2) characterize its nesting habitat. We radio-collared individuals (n = 137) during Mar‒Aug 2013 and 2014 to estimate survival and reproduction and conducted call-count surveys (n = 60 points) during May‒August of both years to estimate occupancy and detection probability. We measured vegetation at nest sites (n = 53 nests) and paired random points to document habitat use. Seasonal survival (0.68‒0.85), clutch size (10‒11 eggs), and nest success (38‒ 59%) were within values reported in past literature. However, relative abundance (0.14‒0.25 calling males/point), occupancy (0.56‒0.73), and probability of detection (0.10‒0.32) were low. Pricklypear (Opuntia engelmannii) was the most common nesting substrate (68%; n = 53 nests), with pricklypear (95% CI β = 0.992‒1.105; P < 0.09), woody plants (95% CI β = 1.001‒1.042; P < 0.04), and native grasses (95% CI β = 0.993‒1.129; P < 0.08) being important variables distinguishing nests from random sites. Nest survival was negatively influenced by non-native grass cover (95% CI β = - 0.115 ‒ -0.006).

Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) is a gamebird that inhabits semi-arid rangelands, whose persistence depends on large habitat tracts and adequate rainfall. Habitat loss and fragmentation have been hypothesized as potential factors influencing the bobwhite decline at large spatial scales; however, long-term changes in weather (i.e. rain, temperature, and soil moisture) traditionally have not been considered as contributing factors. The objective of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis that habitat loss, connectivity, and long-term weather trends influence bobwhite population growth in northern and southern Texas. We used historical (1978–1992) and projected (1992–2022) land cover data from the United States Geological Survey to assess bobwhite habitat connectivity and configuration. We also used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to quantify weather within each region using Palmer Modified Drought Index (PMDI) and breeding season temperature (BST) values. Here we report on the influence of habitat (amount [%] and clumpiness [0-1]) and weather (PMDI and BST) on bobwhite population growth and discuss the relative importance of each. Our findings will 1) provide a better understanding of the degree to which habitat loss, connectivity, and weather influence bobwhites in Texas and 2) help guide species conservation at regional scales.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals I,2025,NA
16,Survival and Cause-specific Mortality of Northern Bobwhite Translocated to the Pineywoods,"Abstract: Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) have largely disappeared from the Pineywoods of Texas due to a multitude of landscape changes. Translocation is an effective method for restoring bobwhite populations in the southeastern United States following habitat restoration. We radiomarked and translocated 240 wild bobwhite – 60 bobwhite in January 2023, March 2023, January 2024, and March 2024 – from Florida to a 3,622-ha area in Polk County, Texas. We monitored bobwhite daily to estimate survival rates and determine mortality causes. During 6 January to 1 October 2023, period survival was 48.1% (95% CI = 37.2-59.2%) and 35.3% (95% CI = 25.4-46.5%) for January and March cohorts, respectively. During 11 January to 3 October 2024, period survival was 33.5% (95% CI = 23.2-45.7%) and 21.6% (95% CI = 13.5-32.9%) for January and March cohorts, respectively. In 2024, avian predation risk was greater (HR = 2.66, 95% CI = 1.61-4.37), mammalian predation was lower (HR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.13-0.69) and snake predation was lower (HR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.45) than 2023. Additionally, March released bobwhite experienced greater avian predation risk (HR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.20-3.12) and lower mammalian predation (HR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.15-0.78) than January released bobwhite. Though survival was lower in 2024, among both years, survival was 1) similar or higher than source populations and 2) higher for January translocated bobwhite. Our findings suggest there is flexibility in release timing when considering bobwhite translocations with potential advantages to January releases in eastern Texas.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals I,2025,NA
17,Release Timing Does Not Influence Nesting of Translocated Northern Bobwhite,"Abstract: Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) have largely disappeared from the Pineywoods of Texas due to a multitude of landscape changes. Translocation is an effective tool for restoring bobwhite populations in the southeastern United States following habitat restoration. Typically, translocations are conducted just prior to the breeding season to maximize breeding potential; however, translocations are logistically intensive and flexibility in release timing would mitigate this difficulty. We radiomarked and translocated 240 wild bobwhite – 60 in January 2023, March 2023, January 2024, and March 2024 – from Florida to a 3,622-ha area in Polk County, Texas. We monitored bobwhite during Apr 15–Oct 15 to estimate reproductive rates. We estimated nest incubation rates (nests/bird alive at the onset of nesting season) and nest success using Poisson and binomial regressions, respectively. We found 74 nests and 45 nests in 2023 and 2024, respectively; incubation rates were higher in 2023 (β2024 = -0.44, 95% CI = -0.81–-0.07, P = 0.02), higher for females (βMales = -0.99, 95% CI = -1.39–-0.58, P < 0.001), but did not differ between release cohorts (βMar = 0.03, 95% CI = -0.33–0.39, P = 0.88). Nest success was higher in 2024 (β2024 = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.05–1.63, P = 0.04) but did not differ by release cohort (βMar = -0.31, 95% CI = -1.05–0.44, P = 0.42) or sex (βMale = -0.07, 95% CI = -0.91–0.77, P = 0.86). Our findings suggest there is flexibility in release timing when considering bobwhite translocations.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals I,2025,NA
18,Leveraging Breeding Bird Survey Data to Assess Factors Influencing Northern Bobwhite Population Stability Across the Species Range,"Abstract: Despite the overall decline of Northern Bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), some population strongholds remain, spread patchily across the species range and encompassing multiple different ecoregions and habitat types. To successfully arrest the decline of Northern Bobwhite, identifying areas where quail are succeeding, where they are in decline, and what factors are driving quail population dynamics across their range is critical. Furthermore, it is important to conduct these analyses across a large spatiotemporal scale to account for annual stochasticity in environmental conditions and structural variation in quail habitat. Although local count data is typically considered a more accurate index of quail abundance by state wildlife agencies, there exists significant variation in data collection methodology among state agencies, which makes comparing these estimates across time and large geographic areas difficult. Because Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data collection protocols are nationally standardized, population estimates based on BBS data can be easily compared between ecoregions across the species’ range. We used Northern Bobwhite BBS data from 1,717 BBS routes to conduct an Emerging Hotspot Analysis with the objective of identifying areas of high (HotSpot) and low (ColdSpot) quail population productivity during a 20-year period from 2000-2019. We then employed Random Forests to examine the influence of landscape composition and configuration, land-use change, plant phenology, weather, drought severity, and human influence on quail population productivity around HotSpots and ColdSpots. We also introduce SaveBirds (www.savebirds.app), a web application designed for wildlife science professionals to mine and format BBS data.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals I,2025,NA
19,Autumn Roadside Surveys for Norhtern Bobwhite in Southern Texas: Efficacy and Modifications,"Abstract: Northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) are an iconic game species that are of increasing concern to wildlife managers due to their erratic populations in southern Texas. Roadside surveys are a common technique used by state agencies and landowners to monitor bobwhite populations. However, these surveys generally assume detection probability is constant across space and time thereby limiting their reliability. Our objectives were to 1) evaluate the influence of landscapes characteristics (e.g., habitat and energy infrastructure) and weather on bobwhite relative abundance, and 2) estimate detection probability during roadside surveys as a function of survey- level covariates (e.g., starting time, date of survey, temperature). We conducted quail roadside surveys on ranches in southern Texas during August‒September 2022 (13 sites; n = 28 total routes) and 2023 (21 sites; n = 43 total routes). Surveys were repeated 4‒6 times, and we remotely collected data for landscape covariates (e.g., habitat, energy infrastructure, and vegetation cover) and weather covariates (e.g., seasonal and annual precipitation, summer temperature, and drought indices) at multiple scales: region (50-km and 16-km window) and site (400-m). We used N-mixture models to evaluate the influence of covariates on abundance and detection probability. Perennial forb and grass cover had the strongest influence on my bobwhite relative abundance model at the site scale (400-km). In addition, we documented a negative relationship between detection probability and date of survey. Our results highlight the importance of perennial herbaceous cover for bobwhite abundance and the need to account for detection probability during roadside surveys to improve data reliability.

20,Vegetation Responses After Disturbance from Ashe Juniper Removal,"Abstract: Woody encroachment of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) is an ongoing problem in many Texas riparian areas. Restoration through mechanical removal of woody encroached species can have unpredictable results on re-establishment of herbaceous and woody species due to soil disturbance, time since removal, the preexisting seed bank, and other environmental factors. Our objective was to examine the response of riparian vegetation after physical removal of Ashe juniper without additional planting of saplings but with reseeding of the herbaceous ground cover. Our study occurs at a tract of riparian land undergoing restoration in north-central Texas in the Western Cross Timbers ecoregion. A contracted company initiated mechanical removal of Ashe juniper within multiple riparian areas along both ephemeral and intermittent streams. In removal areas, we measured stem counts of woody species designated by size class, canopy cover, and herbaceous cover. We reseeded the removal areas with native herbaceous seeds but have allowed woody plants to naturally re-establish. Our study is a before-after treatment design that we analyzed using a two- way ANOVA. Preliminary results from 4 years post-removal data suggest trends towards woody vegetation recovery. We will present results that evaluate juniper regrowth, native and invasive grass recovery, influences of canopy cover on herbaceous cover, and the variation in woody seedling growth across the study area. Our results inform immediate restoration activities, such as herbaceous reseeding, woody planting, and removal of litter, and provide more understanding about community-level responses to Ashe juniper removal.",oral,Natural Resources Management,2025,NA
21,Exploring Mycorrhizal Dynamics: A Comparative Analysis of Rotational vs. Continuous Grazing Systems,"Abstract: Desert ecosystems are vital in supporting ranching by providing essential ecosystem services despite their fragility. In regions where ranching, grazing, and wildlife management are viable, understanding how land management practices affect the ecosystem is essential. Desert grasslands are vulnerable to degradation, particularly those dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis). Management practices can significantly influence plant communities and overall ecosystem health. Different grazing systems were developed to improve ecosystem health and productivity, though their effectiveness is debatable. Blue grama helps maintain productivity in ranching operations as its health closely relates to underground processes, such as the symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). AMF enhances water and nutrient uptake and supports plant resilience. This study examines how different grazing systems – continuous and rotational – affect AMF communities in blue grama across two distinct soil types – Marfa and Musquiz clay loams. Mycorrhizal colonization was evaluated using the magnified gridline intersection method after staining roots to assess these differences. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA, were conducted to evaluate mycorrhizal colonization across plots with continuous and rotational grazing on Marfa and Musquiz clay loams. Rotational grazing resulted in higher mycorrhizal colonization than continuous grazing, suggesting that rotational grazing creates more favorable conditions for mycorrhizal fungi. For landowners and ranchers in the Chihuahuan Desert, this study emphasizes the importance of adopting sustainable land management practices that support the health of mycorrhizal communities. By prioritizing rotational grazing, ranchers can reduce soil compaction, maintain vegetation cover, and support the symbiotic relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi.",oral,Natural Resources Management,2025,NA
22,The Role of Soil Type and Grazing Systems in Shaping Desert Grassland Ecosystems,"Abstract: Desert grasslands are critical ecosystems that support diverse wildlife species and provide valuable resources for livestock production. However, the Trans- Pecos is subjected to habitat degradation if managed incorrectly because of the variable precipitation in desert grasslands. The choice of grazing system has long been debated as to which has the most benefits in meeting a landowner’s goal and sustaining healthy rangelands. The two most common grazing systems, rotational and continuous, can modify and sustain rangeland health. Therefore, this project aims to identify and compare grass species cover, annual standing crop production, species composition, forage nutrition, and soil moisture between a long-term rotational, continuous, and deferred grazing system in a desert grassland of the Trans-Pecos. Grasses were collected at the end of the 2023 and 2024 growing season. Random stratified sampling was used to place 690 0.5 m2 plots in all grazing regimes confined to two soil types (Marfa-clay-loam and Musquiz-clay-loam). Volumetric soil moisture was taken along with all other floristic data at each plot. Linear regression analysis showed that a continuous system will increase soil moisture between all systems overall and has the greatest increase on Musquiz-clay-loam with little to no effect on Marfa-clay-loam. A rotational system with higher overall unique species decreases soil moisture on both soil types compared to the deferred and continuous. With further analysis, this study will reinforce the importance of considering soil types when developing grazing systems and allow for grazing to be used as a management tool to conserve and restore grasslands.",oral,Natural Resources Management,2025,NA
23,Trincheras in the Digital Age: Remote Sensing for Soil Sediment Accumulation Monitoring,"Abstract: Abstract: Wind and/or rainfall weather events displace topsoil in undulating topography when ground vegetation cover is scarce, leading to rangeland degradation and limiting the cycle of ecological processes. Understanding how and where soil erosion occurs is essential for targeting efficient management strategies for restoring rangeland ecological processes and vegetation communities. Remote sensing using fine scale imagery has accelerated rangeland research and presents an opportunity to monitor soil erosion processes. Our research goal is to explore the effectiveness of fine scale remote sensing in measuring displacement of topsoil volumetric data in drainage channels. We did this by estimating soil sediment accumulation within drainage channels using imagery acquired from a cellphone device. To test the accuracy of this method, we added 41.4 liters of soil on the ground and took measurements before and after for comparison. We captured oblique angle imagery from multiple channel perspectives before and after soil placement using a cellphone device. We then constructed a 3D model using SFM (Structure-from-Motion) image processing to create surface and terrain models from before and after soil placement. We then used the surface and terrain models to calculate soil sediment accumulation. We estimated controlled soil addition within 0.1 liters, with 99.998% accuracy. Following the feasibility test, we will estimate soil accumulation in 100 trincheras across 20 stream channels. This methodology can provide volumetric data of soil accumulated at trinchera locations and guide land stewards to fine scale their management improvements in places where erosion control structures can maximize the efficiency of soil retention.",oral,Natural Resources Management,2025,NA
24,The Potential Impact of Climate Change on Herbicide Use in Natural Resource Management,"Abstract: Climate change is affecting the abundance and distribution of plant species globally. These changes result in variation of forage quality and quantity, woody plant encroachment, loss of species diversity, and altered soil properties. Herbicides are valuable in natural resource management as they are used for controlling undesirable species and increasing different vegetation types. Recommendations for efficient application of post-emergent herbicides range between 18.3– 29.4 °C. With increasing temperatures, herbicide application windows will be affected, and their use outside those ranges will negatively impact their effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to quantify how management practices may be affected by climate change at the county level across Texas, USA. To model the changes in the application ranges for herbicide, we used 30-year average temperature data from 1990-2019 and ensemble models with projections from 2021 to 2040. Our data projections show that the number of counties within the application threshold will decrease from 247 to 229 in June, 232 to 177 in July, and 225 to 159 in August by 2040. Therefore, temperature is projected to be a limiting factor during the growing season, especially as temperatures may modify plant phenology and herbicide effectiveness. These results can be applied to other management practices including pesticide application and drone use which also have operational temperatures. For herbicide application to remain a viable management tool, there is a need to develop herbicides or techniques that can be applied during the dormant season or with a wider range of operational temperatures.",oral,Natural Resources Management,2025,NA
25,Occupancy and Habitat Associations Among Owls on the Texas Coastal Bend Region,"Abstract: The nocturnal and elusive behavior of owls makes them challenging species to study. This has resulted in a poor understanding of community structure and distribution among species. This is especially true in the Coastal Bend region of Texas where little research has been conducted on owl communities. Our objectives are to determine owl species-specific occupancy, spatial distributions, and extent of overlap of owl species on the Welder Wildlife Refuge (WWR) in Texas. We used audio playback surveys and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to better understand the distribution of four owl species: the eastern screech-owl (Megascops asio), American barn owl (Tyto furcata), barred owl (Strix varia), and great horned owl (Bubo virginianus). We have conducted three rounds of call-playback surveys for each species at 30 points on the WWR across the array of land cover types it offers. Early occupancy modeling with playback survey data has shown little significance in the relationship between land cover types and occupancy with three out of the four owl species. The barred owl was the only species to show a significant relationship between occupancy and land cover types. This implies a possible generalist behavior among the other owls that may give insight to their land use preferences. PAM recorded data are currently undergoing analyses. Our final results will assess patterns of species-specific occupancy and habitat associations across the refuge. This will allow for a deeper assessment of regional owl population distributions along the Coastal Bend region and possible management implications.

26,Diel and Seasonal Behavioral Patterns of the Newly Recolonizing West Texas Black Bear Population,"Abstract: Black bears (Ursus americanus) began recolonizing the sky island-desert ecosystem in western Texas in the 1980s after being extirpated from the state. Despite their current status as a state-threatened species, little is known about this population or their behavioral patterns. Therefore, we collared 23 bears (14 M, 9 F) with GPS collars programmed with 2-hour fix rates. Using hidden Markov models, we segmented the movement paths into behavioral states based on step lengths, turning angles, residence times, and revisitation rates. We then evaluated the influence of sex, seasonality, and time of day on activity budgets. We found evidence of four states, consistent with resting, foraging, traveling, and a distinctive behavior when using point attractants (e.g. deer feeders). The resting and attractant states represented localized movement behaviors, but the attractant state had disproportionally high residence times and revisitation rates (x̄RT = 40.9hrs ± 0.6(SE), x̄RV = 8.5 ± 0.1). Bears exhibited a crepuscular activity schedule with foraging and traveling peaking between 16:00-22:00h and 04:00-10:00h; however, there was increased nocturnal activity during summer. Traveling peaked during summer, particularly for males who spent nearly 50% of their time traveling in July. The attractant state was most prevalent during hyperphagia, but females had an additional peak in this state post-denning. These activity patterns provide a window into bear bioenergetic budgets, as well as their behavioral adaptations to this unique and highly dynamic desert ecosystem. Flexibility in these patterns may be crucial as they continue to encounter novel abiotic and biotic conditions throughout their recolonization.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals II,2025,NA
27,Identifying the Optimal Survey Design for Estimating Black Bear Density Using Simulated SECR Models,"Abstract: A recent increase in the number of black bears (Ursus americanus) naturally immigrating into western Texas has raised concerns about potential increases in human-bear conflicts. However, with no current information regarding patterns or concentrations in population density, it is unknown when or where to concentrate management action. We intend to use spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) models and genetic information collected from hair snares (detectors) to estimate density along a ~350-km stretch of the Rio Grande River in western Texas, buffered 50- km on the Texas side to encompass any potential gradient of recolonization. This will help identify density hotspots, any spatial or temporal patterns in density, and any potential leading edge of recolonization. However, due to the areas’ large extent (16,629 km2), ruggedness, and remoteness a traditional survey of randomly selected locations will not be logistically feasible. Therefore, to identify a spatial sampling design that will be logistically possible while still producing an accurate estimate of density, we employed the ‘secrdesign’ R package to simulate fitted SECR models to test how different spatial layouts of detectors changed the accuracy and reliability of the produced density estimate. Six hundred and sixteen designs successfully produced results and showed that 40 4x4 grids spaced 10-km apart with detectors spaced 1-km apart surveyed for 8 1-week occasions will produce an accurate density estimate (CV = 12.66) while still being logistically possible in the field. This spatial layout will be used in all future black bear density estimation efforts in western Texas.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals II,2025,NA
28,"Effects of a Large, Linear, Political, Anthropogenic Barrier on Large Carnivore Movement Behavior","Abstract: Anthropogenic structures like fences, walls, or highways can have profound influences on wildlife via impeded movement and genetic isolation. Such research is particularly pressing considering the construction of the ~1500-km border barrier system separating the United States and México. Infrastructure defining property or political boundaries often negatively affects large, mobile, or specialist species. Although segments of the barrier have crossing structures, it is unclear if they are used. Given concern for the viability of large, mobile species in Texas, we quantified behavior of a large carnivore around this potential barrier to connectivity so we can identify areas of successful and unsuccessful crosses. We fit mountain lions (Puma concolor) in South Texas with GPS collars that increase the fix rate from 1-hr to 10-min when the lion comes withing 1-km of the border barrier. We used this fine-scale data in the spatially explicit Barrier Behavior Analysis developed by Xu et al. (2020) to categorize individual lion movement behavior as normal or altered and quantify how often lions approach the barrier. Preliminary results show one individual can circumvent the border barrier system while another has only shown altered movements. Neither individual has used available crossing structures. Of 14 barrier encounters (within 100-m), 11 movements were categorized as altered. On average, individuals encountered the barrier 3 times a month. Our work suggests that the border barrier can affect large carnivore movements. Continued behavior monitoring around the border barrier will inform mitigation and management strategies locally and provide inference for at-risk carnivore populations globally.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals II,2025,NA
29,Drivers of Adult Pronghorn Survival Near the Species’ Geographic Extent,"Abstract: Adult female survival often has the greatest contribution to population trajectory in large mammals. Factors influencing adult survival can be exacerbated in populations living near their geographic extent. Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) vital rates vary geographically, and evidence suggests a population decline at the southeastern extent in Oklahoma. We examined drivers of adult pronghorn survival in Oklahoma to gain insight on population status. In 2022–2024, we captured and GPS- collared 209 pronghorn (150 females and 59 males) in western Oklahoma. We fit Kaplan-Meier survival curves to quantify inter-annual and sex-specific survival rates and assessed drivers of survival via Cox-proportional hazard models including sex, year, and landscape variables. Overall annual pronghorn survival was 74.8% (95% CI: 69.7– 80.3%). Female survival was 76.7% (95% CI: 71.1–82.8%) and male survival was 67.8% (95% CI: 55.8–82.4%). Exclusion of hunter-harvested individuals increased survival estimates by 2.6% and 8.9% for females and males, respectively. Though we did not detect an effect of sex or year, pronghorn that exhibited greater grassland use experienced reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.05–0.69) in contrast to increased mortality risk with greater cropland use (hazard ratio: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.30– 20.50). Compared to pronghorn populations at their geographic core, our adult survival estimates are lower on average. Our results highlight the importance of native grassland communities and the potential negative effects of cropland encroachment.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals II,2025,NA
30,Functional Response of Pronghorn Space Use Relative to Anthropogenic Landscape Factors,"Abstract: Anthropogenic infrastructure (e.g., row-crop agriculture and roads) may alter connectivity or access to important resources. The impact of these anthropogenic features to grassland-dependent wildlife, such as pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), may be dynamic. Pronghorn numbers have declined but persisting populations in mixed-use landscapes may be supplemented by crops. Roads are associated with cropland, but avoidance of roads is well documented in pronghorn throughout North America. Our objective was to assess relationships between pronghorn use of cropland and roads in the form of a functional response. We GPS-collared 75 pronghorn from 2017 to 2019 in the Texas Panhandle and modeled how use changed with availability. We estimated pronghorn home ranges (mean = 80.5 km2, SD = 75 km2) and found pronghorn used cropland in proportion to its availability but had higher use than available when home ranges contained ~25 - 60% cropland. Further, pronghorn had high proportional use of cropland when their home range was ≤ 2 km from cropland, but had little use when living > 2 km away. Pronghorn used paved roads less than was available, with declining use as availability increased. Pronghorn used unpaved roads slightly less than available, and had almost no use at lower levels of availability. A pronghorn ecological paradox may exist between the nutritive value of row-crops versus habitat loss and fragmentation via row-crop agriculture and roads. Row crops may reduce native habitat but diversify nutritional resources, although this benefit may be unpredictable as proximity and availability of cropland was highly influential in pronghorn use.

31,Using Geographic Information Systems to Examine the Potential Impact of Wind Turbines on Grassland Birds,"Abstract: Wind energy is a known way for humans to reduce emissions from the use of fossil fuels. However, there is limited public discourse and research on how wind energy impacts birds and other wildlife. Grassland birds are one of the most threatened groups of avifauna in North America and the geographic ranges of many species overlap the majority of current and future wind energy capacity in the United States. We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and the United States Wind Turbine Database to examine the potential impact of wind turbines on abundance and diversity of grassland birds. Using ArcGIS Pro, we created a Turbine Proximity Index (TPI) that quantitatively assesses wind energy development along BBS routes. This index takes into account the number of turbines within a set distance of the route, 10km and 2.5km. We then employed a Before-After-Control-Impact study design to examine the change in abundance and species richness in relation to TPI for routes within the study region. Land cover composition along the routes was also taken into account in the BACI analysis. Our study provided limited evidence that wind turbines have a detectable negative effect on abundance and species richness of grassland birds at a landscape scale. However, some of the regression models used in the BACI design had relatively low statistical power. Further research is warranted particularly with regard to testing for effects of turbines on specific species.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds II,2025,NA
32,Avian Community Response to Removal of Encroaching Woody Vegetation in Trans-Pecos Grasslands,"Abstract: The grasslands of North America are one of the fastest declining habitat types on the continent. This is due to a variety of reasons, including energy conversion, livestock grazing, and woody plant encroachment. As a result of this habitat loss, grassland-obligate bird species are in steep decline across the continent. An estimated 88% of migratory grassland birds overwinter in the Chihuahuan Desert. Woody plant encroachment within the Chihuahuan Desert has decreased available grasses, leading to a reduction in winter food availability and nocturnal thermal cover. Encroached woody vegetation also provides more habitat and perching opportunities for avian predator species, such as loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Grassland restoration efforts typically involve brush removal using herbicide, mechanical removal, and fire. In the Trans-Pecos, we are studying sites within the Marathon and Marfa grasslands where herbicide and mechanical removal have been used on mesquite varieties (Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var. glandulosa and Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var. torreyana), creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), and tarbush (Flourensia venus). We are conducting non-breeding bird surveys and vegetation surveys across a control site, a site 3 years post-herbicide treatment, and a site that used mechanical removal 4 years after having been treated with herbicide. Preliminary results indicate reduction in brush greenness after treatments and variation in target bird abundance across years. Ultimately, this project will help inform broad- scale restoration that will hopefully result in population increases for species currently listed as Species of Greatest Conservation Need.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds II,2025,NA
33,Linking Cross-scale Dynamics in Landscape Patterns to Declines in a Ground-nesting Galliform,"Abstract: Ecosystem dynamics and landscape heterogeneity can cause organisms to respond to novel pressures at different spatial and temporal scales. Organisms are expected to have disparate responses to ecological factors across different spatio- temporal scales depending on landscape context and functional traits of the organism. In semi-arid systems, resources and conditions frequently change in distribution and abundance based on, but not limited to, climatic patterns. Additionally, these systems are increasingly altered by anthropogenic activity that may functionally change the ecosystem over longer temporal scales. In South Texas, the chestnut-bellied scaled quail (Callipepla squamata castanogastris; hereafter: “quail”) population have experienced distribution-wide declines in recent decades broadly believed to be a result of land use change and fragmentation. However, understanding responses to scales of effect of these novel pressures are lacking. To assess this, we used 30-years of quail abundance data from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s annual quail survey along with landscape data from the Rangeland Analysis Platform to assess variation in the scale of effect for landscape dynamics across a broad temporal extent. Specifically, we used generalized additive models to identify scale of effects for nine predictive landscape variables, and modeled their effect on relative quail abundance. We found positive, nonlinear trends in relative quail abundance for woody cover. We also identified potential directional thresholds in the effects of tree and bare ground cover on relative abundance. Our results illustrate the cross-scale dependency of landscape dynamics on long-term relative abundance trends of this culturally important gamebird.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds II,2025,NA
34,Current Recovery Efforts for the Attwater’s Greater Prairie-chicken,"Abstract: The Attwater’s greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri, APC) was listed as endangered with extinction in 1967. Its numbers continued to decline over the following 25 years, and a captive breeding program was initiated in 1992 to preserve genetic diversity and provide birds for supplementing populations and re-establishing extirpated populations. Herein we provide an update of recent recovery efforts. In 2024, APC were reared at four facilities: Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, Houston Zoo, Caldwell Zoo, and Sutton Avian Research Center. These facilities bred 61 hens and produced 607 chicks that survived to 8 weeks. Two wild populations exist at Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge (APCNWR), Colorado County, Texas, and on private lands in Goliad and Refugio counties. We surveyed booming grounds in March and April 2024 and tallied 20 males at APCNWR and 53 in Goliad County; this represented a 1-year decrease of 4 males at APCNWR and increase of 8 males on the leks surveyed in Goliad County. In 2023, an additional 3 leks were surveyed in Goliad County with 19 males on a ranch that was not available for surveying in 2024.

35,Management of Attwater’s Greater Prairie-chickens Infected with Reticuloendotheliosis Virus,"Abstract: Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) has hampered recovery efforts of the Attwater’s greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri, APC) since it was first reported in APC in 1998. REV commonly occurs in wild bird populations of many species at low prevalence but is rarely associated with clinical disease in wild birds. REV is incurable, and chronic infection in captive birds eventually results in lower productivity and health. Thus, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has worked with captive breeding facility managers to maintain an REV-free captive flock by culling individual birds that test positive. However, this strategy entails risks. First, this approach can result in the loss of a large portion of the breeding population; for example, 16 of 19 breeders tested positive and were culled from one flock from November 2023 through January 2024. Second, APC can thrive for several years with REV, and these individuals may have genetic traits for disease resistance that could benefit the species. Third, APC in the current captive breeding facilities cannot be completely isolated from vectors of REV that transmit the disease from wild birds, resulting in frequent incidences of REV-infected APC. Finally, APC in the wild have low survival, and thus additional mortalities due to REV may be inconsequential. For these reasons, we asked subject matter experts to assess the likelihood and severity of risks associated with four options for management of APC infected with REV. We review the biology of this disease and the responses we received regarding perceived risks for these management options.

36,"5 Years of Gem: Lessons Learned from Polishing the Grassland Effectiveness Monitoring Program Alex Nelson, Rio Grande Joint Venture/Oaks and Prairies Joint Venture, Wichita Falls,","Abstract: Grasslands are an imperiled ecosystem in North America, with 2/3 of the historical distribution of this critical habitat lost to shrub encroachment, agricultural conversion, overgrazing, and other disturbances. In response, habitat restoration programs implement practices like brush management, prescribed fire, herbicide treatment, and prescribed grazing. About $2.8 million/year is spent implementing these practices on private lands by U.S. Fish and Wildlife’s Southwest Region’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife program, and millions more is spent by other federal/state programs. However, consistent monitoring data is scarcely available to assess habitat outcomes at large scales. The tiered Grassland Effectiveness Monitoring (GEM) protocol is demonstrating success in quantifying changes in various vegetation metrics. Between 2021 and 2024, GEM has been implemented by the Oaks and Prairies and Rio Grande Joint Ventures (among other partners) in three U.S. states (Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico) and in Chihuahua, Mexico. In 2025, the Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma plans to use GEM to assess grassland projects. Though sophisticated data analyses are still underway, the GEM team has learned valuable lessons about data collections across large geographies, data organization using Survey123 and R platforms, storing and making data available to end-users, and how to best advertise and make GEM products available for those interested in using these protocols. Thus, GEM data applications towards research and land management decisions are many, but expanding capacity to support data storage and analysis remains a focus of the program’s development.",oral,"Biometrics, Population Monitoring, & Citizen Science",2025,NA
37,Use of eBird Community Science Data to Predict the Distribution of Wintering Grassland Songbirds in the Western Cross Timbers Ecoregion,"Abstract: Grassland songbirds are one of the most threatened groups of birds in North America and under-researched in their wintering range. Community science projects such as eBird collect useful data for creating species distribution models, but can be biased towards human-dense regions, highly detectable species, and breeding or migratory seasons. Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) are declining grassland songbirds that overwinter in north-central Texas but are rare on eBird in this area. Our objective was to use eBird data to predict encounter rate and distribution of savannah sparrows across the Western Cross Timbers ecoregion. We will also obtain predictions for increasing encounter rates. We obtained 10 years (2014–2024) of complete eBird checklists (n = 9,171) between October to March within the study area and created a detection/non-detection dataset (n = 571 detections). We used a random forest model with checklist location, presence-absence, landcover data, elevation, and effort variables as predictors of savannah sparrow distribution. We evaluated model performance using sensitivity, specificity, Precision-Recall AUC, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Our preliminary results show that the top-performing model had an AUC = 0.15, suggesting further refinement is needed. The top landcover predictors are length of edge of grasslands and percent landcover of parkland. Variables for survey effort indicated that surveys from December to February, with increased search area, and for a minimum of 2 hr will increase encounter rates in our area. This modeling approach can inform species distribution models of uncommon bird species using community science data.",oral,"Biometrics, Population Monitoring, & Citizen Science",2025,NA
38,Outcome-based Monitoring for Assessing Fall and Winter Surface Water Availability for Waterfowl Habitat in the Texas Gulf Coast Region,"Abstract: Migratory Bird Joint Ventures use a partnership-based approach to deliver geographically- specific bird population and habitat objectives. The Texas portion of the Gulf Coast Joint Venture (GCJV) provides suitable habitat for migrating and wintering waterfowl. The GCJV uses bioenergetic models to translate winter waterfowl population targets into habitat objectives for this important region. Through annual assessments of fall and winter surface water availability, the GCJV evaluates progress toward habitat objectives and informs conservation priorities. Remotely sensed imagery (e.g., Landsat) was used to quantify abundance of fall and winter waterfowl habitat on inland agricultural lands in the Texas portion of the GCJV during three periods of its fall-winter planning window. The GCJV quantified waterfowl inland agricultural habitat abundance for 38 fall-winter periods (1985–2024), revealing significant inter- and intra-annual variation in habitat abundance within and among Texas Initiative Area planning regions. Inland agricultural waterfowl habitat objectives were achieved 48–60% of early period assessments and 8–70% of mid-late period assessments across Texas Initiative Areas. These data depict the spatial and temporal variation in waterfowl habitat across the Texas portion of the GCJV landscape. We will demonstrate how outcome-based monitoring contributes to assessing progress toward habitat objectives. Targeted wetland delivery programs, like the Texas Prairie Wetlands Project can contribute to achieving fall-winter, inland agricultural GCJV waterfowl habitat objectives.",oral,"Biometrics, Population Monitoring, & Citizen Science",2025,NA
39,Did You Hear That? Counting Quail Using Autonomous Recorders and Hierarchical Models,"Abstract: Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are increasingly used in avian research and management due to their ability to survey large spatial extents across long temporal periods. However, a drawback of ARUs is the ability to process data accurately and efficiently, but recent developments in acoustic classifiers show promise in expediting acoustic data workflows. To investigate the efficacy of ARUs for avian species management, we deployed 27 ARUs across La Copita Demonstration Ranch and Research Area in southern Texas during the northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, quail) breeding season (May-July) to estimate abundance. To process the acoustic data, we used two acoustic classifiers: BirdNET, an open-source classifier, and a quail-specific classifier. We implemented a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate quail abundance that accounts for: 1) false positives, 2) detection, and 3) and factors influencing abundance. We collected 1,249 hours of acoustic data across 93, thirty-minute morning surveys and used 54 hours (4 days) which detected 2,038 quail calls. To validate the acoustic model, we conducted point counts at 10 sites using mental capture-recapture and detected 69 quail across 4 survey periods. We will assess whether estimates of quail abundance from the acoustic models are comparable to estimates obtained from the point count model and determine a acoustic classifier’s false positive rate influence on precision. Our findings will present a workflow for using ARUs as a method for avian monitoring and management.",oral,"Biometrics, Population Monitoring, & Citizen Science",2025,NA
40,Optimizing Spatially Explicit Capture-recapture Study Design Across Varying Animal Movement Strategies,"Abstract: How animals move through space is an important consideration when designing studies to estimate wildlife population parameters. When estimating population density using closed capture-recapture models, heterogeneity in animal movement and home range location can bias detection probabilities. However, spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models improve density estimates by incorporating the spatial scale of an individual’s movement and the location of an individual’s home- range center relative to trap locations. Advances in GPS collars have also expanded our ability to identify animal movement models and integrate them into SECR frameworks. While simulation studies have provided several optimizations for SECR detector array designs, accounting for different animal movement patterns remains a knowledge gap. Our objective was to use simulations to determine the optimal detector array design across five animal movement models: random-walk, nomadic, central place, habitat- driven, and territorial. Each movement pattern was simulated 100 times under an evenly-spaced, random, and clustered trap array design, with encounter histories created under the Poisson encounter model. We further assessed the impact of selecting detector locations based on habitat configuration. We evaluated bias, coverage, and root mean square error and found that evenly-spaced arrays generally perform well across metrics and movement patterns. We found that random arrays often also perform almost as well but that clustered arrays can have high error and low precision, especially under more complex movement. These results can be used by researchers to determine the ideal array design for multiple known movement models and the most versatile design when movement patterns are unknown.

41,Niche Separation Between a Sympatric Specialist and Generalist Felid in Tamaulipan Thornscrub,"Abstract: Similarly-sized animals with overlapping ranges and natural histories have the potential to have competitive interactions, which can lead to spatial or temporal segregation in resource use. In South Texas, two mesocarnivores of similar size, ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) and bobcats (Lynx rufus), coexist in Tamaulipan thornscrub. It has been demonstrated that the endangered ocelot is a closed canopy specialist, relying on dense thornscrub cover, while bobcats are habitat generalists and are able to adapt to a variety of mixed and open canopy cover environments. Using a two-species occupancy model, we sought to better understand the drivers in the probability of use of thornscrub cover and other vegetative communities to understand the niche separation between bobcats and ocelots. To achieve this, we deployed a 1- km2 camera grid on the East Foundation’s ~ 109-km2 El Sauz ranch with data collected from February through July 2024. We hypothesized that ocelots would be more likely to occur at sites where bobcats are also present and where percent thornscrub cover is more extensive, reflecting their dense thornscrub specialization. Conversely, we predicted that bobcats would be more likely to occur independently of ocelots and where there are mixed or open canopy vegetation types. Our results will assist in better understanding the spatial dynamics of bobcats and ocelots and will have important implications for endangered ocelot recovery in South Texas.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals III,2025,NA
42,Genetic Diversity of Federally Endangered Ocelots in the United States,"Abstract: Managing for genetic diversity in endangered species is critical, given that low genetic diversity can reduce fitness and impact population viability. Small populations at the peripheries of their range are particularly susceptible to loss of diversity via genetic drift and inbreeding. Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) are a widely distributed felid species in the Americas, but listed as endangered in the United States. Currently, there are as few as 100 individuals in two isolated populations in South Texas, one on privately-owned ranchlands, and the other on the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge. To improve long-term viability of ocelots in South Texas, a new federally-supported reintroduction program has been initiated, making baseline information on the current state of genetic diversity a critical need. We genotyped 170 wild ocelots sampled from 1990 to 2024 and grouped them into six geographic and temporal groups based on capture year and location. We used whole genome sequencing and microsatellite analysis to estimate indices of genetic diversity, quantify inbreeding, assess divergence among populations, and identify potential dispersers. Pairwise FST increased between the Ranch and Refuge populations across time, indicative of genetic drift and accumulation of inbreeding. Individuals in both populations had longs runs of homozygosity, reflective of recent inbreeding. We detected the first dispersal events between the populations in > 30 years, as two individuals caught in the Refuge population were genetically assigned to the Ranch population. Our results showed recent connectivity between these two populations and suggests the potential for natural gene flow to aid species recovery.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals III,2025,NA
43,From Co-occurrence Patterns to Trophic Interactions: A Meta-analysis of Spatial and Temporal Co-occurrence in Carnivora Mammals and Their Preys,"Abstract: Empirical assessment of antagonistic interactions in mammals is challenging. Therefore, most studies have relied on indirect evidence such as the spatial or temporal species co-occurrence patterns, to make inferences about interactions. The suitability of co-occurrence patterns hinges on the assumption that factors influencing interaction intensity would reflect on the spatial and temporal distribution of species. However, previous assessments of mammal co-occurrence patterns have shown context- dependence and controversial results. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to elucidate how the morphological and behavioral traits of species and environmental factors affect mammal's spatial and temporal co-occurrence patterns. To examine the relationship of co-occurrence patterns with species traits and latitude, we employed a generalized linear mixed model approach. We selected a total of 152 peer- reviewed studies published between 2010 and 2022. We found evidence of how body mass ratio, latitude, and hunting strategy, contribute to explaining pairwise co- occurrence patterns of predator-prey species. Nonetheless, the alignment between these drivers and co-occurrence patterns did not match expectations for predator-prey interactions. Furthermore, the importance and direction of relationships between the variables and co-occurrence patterns changed contingent upon the analyzed dimension (spatial or temporal), and predator family identity. Overall, we found body mass ratio and hunting strategy can be useful for inferring predator-prey interactions from co- occurrence patterns. The variables and relationships identified in this study, when approached within a suitable conceptual and analytical framework, have the potential to foster valid interpretations from mammalian co-occurrence data.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals III,2025,NA
44,Drought Events Alter Endangered Ocelot Movement and Niche Overlap with Bobcats at Their Northern Range Boundary in South Texas,"Abstract: Ongoing environmental change is altering climatic conditions globally, with pronounced effects on the ecology of species and communities. Consequently, conservation and management are increasingly challenged with recovering species in systems that are dissimilar to historical baselines. Climate extremes (e.g., drought) can be challenging for animals both physiologically and behaviorally when resources are limited and the cost to forage, avoid predators, and find mates increases. However, few studies have quantified how abiotic extremes affect activity patterns, space use, and ultimately energetic demands in the context of species recovery. To better understand the role climate extremes have on species recovery, we estimated daily movement rates and habitat selection of the federally endangered ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and a sympatric carnivore (bobcat Lynx rufus) across periods of drought in South Texas, USA between 2017 and 2024. We used GPS telemetry to calculate energy expenditure and predicted the physiological cost of alternate climatic scenarios. We found the extreme drought conditions increased niche overlap between ocelots and bobcats in space and time. In addition, we found ocelots increased their daily distance traveled during periods of drought and consequently increased daily energy expenditure. Extreme abiotic conditions pose difficult challenges for management with limited tools to mitigate climate, but understanding behavioral changes and physiological limitations is critical to evaluate progress toward species recovery and promote long-term persistence.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals III,2025,NA
45,First Recorded Between-population Dispersal of a Male Ocelot in South Texas: Its Significance for Planning the Recovery of the Species the United States,"Abstract: In the United States, two known breeding endangered ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) populations remain, with both found in southern Texas. The smaller Refuge Population is in Cameron County and occupies the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge (LANWR) and surrounding areas, while the larger Ranch Population occurs to the north on private lands in Willacy and Kenedy Counties. For the past 40 years that ocelots have been studied in Texas, lack of evidence led researchers to believe that these populations were isolated from each other. Nevertheless, in March 2024, a research team from the Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute at Texas A&M University – Kingsville captured at LANWR a male ocelot with a pit tag that corresponded to an individual captured a year earlier by the East Foundation in the Ranch Population. This ocelot, LAO04M-24, traveled at least 37 kilometers between capture locations. Bloodwork and physical examination did not reveal any clinically significant impacts to health after dispersal, and the ocelot’s present movements suggest a resident status in the Refuge Population with a core area of space use established in LANWR. New genetic evidence from a concurrent study indicates that ocelot dispersal has occurred between these populations in recent years, and the recorded dispersal of ocelot LAO04M-24 offers a time frame for dispersal and information about the individual’s physiological conditions before and after dispersal. This recorded dispersal and current research on ocelot movements has implications for ocelot recovery planning, especially surrounding strategies to promote population connectivity or conduct augmentation of the populations.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals III,2025,NA
46,"Connectivity and Urban Greenspaces: Evaluating the Role of Landscape Factors on Urban Carnivore Occupancy in Denton, Texas","Abstract: Urban greenspaces can provide multiple services: from positive outdoor recreation to a conduit of protection for urban species across an urban matrix. Connectivity plays an important role for urban carnivore persistence along a fragmented landscape, with green spaces aiding in travel and/or to acquire resources. Although connectivity depends on many landscape factors, recent studies suggest that interconnectedness of an urban green space is an important attribute to consider for urban carnivores. Identifying which landscape factors hold an ecological importance for certain species is critical to understand urban carnivore persistence in a human- dominated landscape. For my study, I investigate how land attributes of the urban landscape in Denton, Texas impact patterns of occupancy for bobcats (Lynx rufus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) in urban greenspaces. Density estimations were captured via double-camera stations (59, 118) across six different study sites from June-November 23’& 24’, using spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) analysis. Each site was classified by degree of isolation and spatially modeled via land cover variables like land use, patch size, and least cost path (LCP), to determine their linkage in the landscape. Primary data show coyotes are present in all sites, while bobcats had a high probability of detection in all sites except one. The greenspace with low bobcat detection also has a high degree of isolation and low connectivity based on LCP and flow analysis. Results suggest that the availability of corridors is important for bobcat intensity of use of a greenspace, along with the land use and management of this landscape.

47,Diversity of Migrating and Wintering Birds at Livestock Tanks in the Trans- Pecos,"Abstract: Birds overwintering in the Chihuahuan Desert grasslands have declined by 70% since 1970. In the harsh climate of the arid southwest, dirt livestock tanks could be an important source of water, food, and shelter for migratory bird species. Our study documents which migrating and wintering birds of the Trans-Pecos utilize dirt livestock tanks and evaluates how characteristics such as tank size, brush density, and water level relate to bird diversity and abundance. We are using double-observer point count surveys and automated recording units (ARUs) to determine what bird species are present at dirt livestock tanks and how they are utilizing them. Point count survey results have shown significant diversity of birds actively using livestock tanks, with 52 species of birds across 22 families and 9 orders detected from September 2023 through March 2024. Birds represented in the results include raptors, shorebirds, warblers, sparrows, flycatchers, and ducks, and 14 out of the 52 bird species are grassland specialists. Most of the grassland habitats in the Trans-Pecos are privately owned and cattle are often used to manage these habitats (e.g., enhancing plant biodiversity through grazing). The goal of this study is to produce management recommendations for dirt livestock tanks, such as maximum levels of brush and optimum tank size, that will allow private landowners to meet their bird conservation goals while supporting their livestock operations.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds III,2025,NA
48, Avian Community Science on American College Campuses Across the Central Flyway,"Abstract: Rapid urbanization is altering native ecosystems at alarming rates creating a growing necessity to understand habitat usage in urban areas. Of chief concern are migratory birds who are currently experiencing unprecedented declines numbering in the billions. These birds require high quality habitat for stopover sites in order to refuel and rest, which is becoming more scarce due to habitat loss and fragmentation. One often overlooked source of habitat are college and university campuses. These habitat patches not only provide the opportunity to evaluate unique human-wildlife interactions but also house native vegetation in many urban areas. Due to the lack of effective sampling, we don’t possess the power to analyze these campuses on a macro level. Using community science we analyze the sampling effort of 368 college campuses along the North American Central Flyway, one of four major avian migratory routes through the United States. We consider multiple landscape variables such as urbanization, light pollution, and vegetation cover in conjunction with institutional characteristics to elucidate these relationships. Our results indicate associations with multiple anthropogenic environmental variables as well as interactions with institutional attributes. In this talk, we will discuss these results and how they influence our idea of what composes an active biodiverse campus. Understanding the environmental relationships between campus and ecosystem will allow for more effective conservation practices as well as development of wide-scale biodiversity monitoring.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds III,2025,NA
49,Space Use and Movements of Inland Wintering Whooping Cranes in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo Population,"Abstract: Aransas-Wood Buffalo Population (AWBP) whooping cranes are increasingly using inland areas for a portion of the winter. There have been individuals near Granger Lake during 5 of the last 13 winters and 11 of the last 13 winters in Colorado and Wharton counties, Texas, USA. At least 11 individuals used Colorado/Wharton counties in 2022–2023 and 18 in 2023–2024. We utilized data from all whooping cranes with active transmitters from 2009-2018, and from 3 additional inland wintering individuals from 2017–2022. We compared 95% auto-correlated kernel density estimates (AKDE) and daily distance movements for coastal wintering cranes and those that spent a portion of their winter inland. We also examined daily movement patterns in relation to wintering range use (inland or coastal) considering demographic and temporal factors with Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models (GLMM). Six marked birds across 10 bird-winters from 2011–2021 spent between 3.1-99.3% of their winter at inland areas. Inland wintering birds had AKDE home ranges that were 3.1 times as large as coastal wintering birds. Additionally, the top GLMM predicted that spending a portion of the winter at inland areas equated to a 92.0±4.2% increase in daily movement during the winter. We found that several other factors influenced daily movement patterns, which warrant consideration when comparing between the groups. Daily movements followed a quadratic temporal pattern with greater movements in the late fall and early spring. Continued use of inland areas has implications for how we manage, monitor, and plan for this population’s recovery.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds III,2025,NA
50,Energy Expenditure of Northern Pintail in Response to Climatic Variation During Spring Migration,"Abstract: Thermal extremes during spring migration compound energetic costs to birds already under selective pressure to maximize fitness by balancing time and energy requirements, which may carry implications for their fitness. Under projected climate change scenarios, increased incidence of extreme weather events and warming trends may further constrain activity patterns and energetics during migration. However, individual trait variation and thermal refugia may allow individuals to better cope with these stressors. The northern pintail (Anas acuta; hereafter, “pintail”) is a circumpolar species of dabbling duck. Pintails arrive earlier than most dabbling duck species to breeding areas of the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. This likely exposes individuals to the species’ lower thermal limits. Pintails also demonstrate earlier migration related to spring warming trends. We will use spring migration-track data from female pintails fitted with GPS transmitters, equipped with accelerometers, in their Southwestern U.S. winter range (n = 280; 2019-2023). We will examine the constraints thermoregulation may place on migratory activity under present and projected climatic conditions. We will model the relationship between standard metabolic rate (based on microclimate model-predicted air temperatures and mass) and overall dynamic body acceleration (energy expenditure) using generalized additive models to identify thresholds in activity responses. We expect our novel approach in a migratory wetland bird will provide a mechanistic understanding of avian migration energetics given climatic variation and inform adaptive conservation planning under climate change.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds III,2025,NA
51,Influence of Hunting on Waterfowl Diel Use of Texas Wetlands,"Abstract: Sanctuaries (i.e., non-hunted wetlands) are important for waterfowl during the hunting season and have been shown to increase local waterfowl abundance and diversity. The Texas Coast Waterfowl Sanctuary Program, created by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, aims to enroll private wetland sites to serve as waterfowl sanctuaries in areas with high hunting pressure. In the presence of hunting disturbance, some waterfowl preferentially use sanctuaries during the day and increase use of hunted wetlands at night. Understanding the dynamics of species presence and diel use patterns for different waterfowl species can help inform habitat management. Traditional waterfowl survey techniques provide incomplete coverage across the diel cycle and introduce potential biases and disturbances to birds. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) have become increasingly common in avian research but to date, applications for surveying waterfowl have been limited. Our objective is to examine diel occupancy of waterfowl in sanctuaries and hunted wetlands using ARUs. We deployed ARUs using a paired comparison design in wetlands along the Texas coast from November 2023 to March 2024. We used BirdNET, a machine learning classifier, to detect vocalizations of snow geese (Anser caerulescens), American wigeon (Mareca americana), and green- winged teal (Anas crecca). Results will be used to investigate how wetland characteristics impact waterfowl use of wetlands throughout the entire 24-hour cycle.

52,"Factors Influencing Waterbird Preferred Habitat Use of the Zandmotor Beach, Monster, Netherlands","Abstract: Building with Nature solutions that provide waterbird habitat have added benefits to socio-ecological systems including supporting ecosystem services, providing enhanced erosion control, and encouraging recreation opportunities, among others. By understanding habitat parameters that attract birds, managers can replicate these conditions in other areas. This study seeks to determine what variables affect the presence of waterbirds in habitat created by the Sand Motor, a Dutch beach mega- nourishment project. Lessons learned in the Netherlands can be used to benefit future coastal resiliency projects in Texas’ Galveston Bay system. Data on waterbird use of the Zandmotor Beach were collected during field surveys in May/ June 2024. Variables were both field observed (species, behavior, microhabitat, hours to low tide, etc.) and GIS generated (beach width, land cover within 100 m buffer, etc.). Of the 499 birds recorded, 82.6% were actively roosting while the remaining 17.4% were observed in feeding behavior. Observations were analyzed for statistical significance using Poisson regression to determine which factors predicted the number of expected waterbirds (R2 value= 0.43, Chi2= 0). Significant variables included daytime temperature (+), wind speed (+), count of recreational users (-), percentage habitat classified as mud flat (+)/ sand (+)/and moist sand (+). This study on the Sand Motor 13 years after construction, provides conclusive evidence of the importance of manmade habitat to vulnerable bird populations in addition to its function as coastline protection. Knowledge of variables driving habitat selection will allow new coastal resiliency structures to be built with added features to support more waterbirds.

53,Herpetofaunal Impediment and Entanglement Risks in Erosion Control Products,"Abstract: Urbanization in Texas has increased road construction projects, contributing to the number of deployed erosion control products (ECPs). These ECPs include erosion control blankets composed of synthetic or organic mesh and matrices, which may create risks of entanglement and mortality to wildlife. Anecdotal reports exist of herpetofauna experiencing entanglement and mortality in ECPs, creating concern that ECPS may affect threatened and endangered taxa. Our objective is to evaluate risks that ECPs may pose to herpetofauna in Texas. We selected frog and toad (Anura), lizard (Squamata, “Lacertilia”), and turtles and tortoises (Testudines) as proxy species to represent wild or at-risk taxa. We obtained 12 ECPs with differing materials, netting, and matrices. We conducted field trials by installing ECPs either in a controlled area or an experimental arena (3.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 m). We recorded behaviors, impediments, and entanglement to gauge potential risks posed by each product. We measured body sizes and recorded ECP composition. Preliminary results suggest that smaller reptile species or individuals [three-toed box turtle (Terrapene triunguis), Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri), Texas alligator lizard (Gerrhonotus infernalis)] may experience more frequent and moderate impediments (n = 22; 11 mild, 9 moderate, 2 severe) and entanglements (n = 10; 6 mild, 2 moderate, 1 severe) than larger individuals. Amphibians experienced fewer impediments and no entanglements. Frequency and severity of impediment and entanglement varied between ECP types. These trials are part of a larger project studying risks that different ECP materials pose to various wild taxa in Texas.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Reptiles & Amphibians,2025,NA
54,Texas Tortoise Movement Ecology in a Fire-managed Rangeland,"Abstract: Fire is a natural ecological process that structures many ecosystems globally. Prescribed fire can be used to mimic historical fire regimes in areas where fire has been suppressed by humans, which in turn alters vegetation species composition and structure. Thus, it is important to examine the effects of fire on wildlife species to understand the implications for species conservation. In southern Texas, prescribed fire is used to manage woody plant encroachment and improve quality of forage for cattle and wildlife in the Tamaulipan biotic province, which is inhabited by Texas tortoises (Gopherus berlandieri). We assessed the movement and resource use of Texas tortoises in response to prescribed fire on a coastal rangeland in southern Texas. Rangeland sites ≥200 ha were randomly assigned to winter or summer prescribed fire at 3- or 5-year fire return intervals. In treatment and control sites, we equipped 30 tortoises with GPS tags and iButton temperature loggers. We also collected surface temperature using iButtons. Using GPS locations, landcover classification, and temperature data, we conducted resource selection analyses to compare tortoise ecology before and after fires. During the summer, the area (ha) used by tortoises increased post-fire for 6 weeks, whereas space use did not change during winter. Net squared displacement data indicated tortoises showed site fidelity during both seasons. These data and findings describe how fire affects Texas tortoise ecology, which will aid in developing strategies for integrating fire into holistic management plans to minimize the impact on tortoises while benefiting other wild and domestic animals.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Reptiles & Amphibians,2025,NA
55,Changes in Herpetofauna Communities Across a Gradient of Native and Invasive Vegetation,"Abstract: Nonnative and invasive plants are considered a conservation threat to native ecosystems. As ecosystems are invaded, invasive plants can replace native plant species resulting in changes in the vegetative structure, which may serve as an ecological filter. Additionally, this replacement may negatively impact ecosystem function by altering trophic systems as a bottom-up control mechanism. Herpetofauna species can serve as indicators of ecosystem health due to the multiple trophic roles these species fill; however, little is known of their response to invasive vegetation and habitat change in southern Texas. To evaluate impacts of invasive vegetation on herpetofauna communities, we sampled herpetofauna at the Welder Wildlife Refuge in San Patricio County, Texas, USA. We sampled across six plots: two native, two invasive, and two intermediate vegetative communities. We collected data during 2020- 2023, and we recorded 530 captures of 31 reptile species and 6,370 captures of 12 amphibian species. We compared beta diversity of herpetofauna among vegetative communities and sampling years. Beta diversity differed between native and invaded vegetation communities for reptiles, but not for amphibians. For both groups, beta diversity differed between drought years and years with normal or above average rainfall. Drought conditions can impact overall vegetative conditions and microhabitat conditions. The level of invasive vegetation along with drought conditions may drive differences in herpetofauna community structure. This work will provide information on herpetofauna community responses to invasive vegetation which has implications for health and conservation of grassland ecosystems.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Reptiles & Amphibians,2025,NA

Invasive plants (e.g., Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera)), can alter habitat characteristics by influencing nutrient dynamics, often to the detriment of amphibians. We investigated how Chinese tallow and two native species, Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda) and Shumard Oak (Quercus shumardii) leaf litter influence amphibian oviposition site selection. We hypothesized that amphibians initially select sites with favorable water quality, such as higher dissolved oxygen and neutral pH, but avoid them at high conspecific densities due to priority effects, with later arriving eggs facing increased risk of cannibalism. Using a factorial design, we tested leaf litter species and concentrations in aquatic mesocosms, and monitored the presence of adults, amplexic pairs, eggs, tadpoles nightly, tadpole relative abundance, and water quality parameters. Tadpole abundance was higher in Loblolly Pine and Shumard Oak mesocosms. Mesocosms containing Chinese tallow leaf litter, particularly at higher concentrations, revealed the most pronounced changes in water quality, with significantly lower pH and dissolved oxygen levels and higher specific conductivity and total dissolved solids. Turbidity and temperature were not significantly influenced by leaf litter treatments. These findings indicate that leaf litter species influence water quality, affecting amphibian oviposition preferences. The observed impacts of Chinese tallow highlight the need for its management in wetland habitats, as its presence alters environmental conditions critical for amphibian reproductive success.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Reptiles & Amphibians,2025,NA
57,Using Herpetofauna to Determine Wetland Health and Function in the Red River Watershed,"Abstract: Wetland restoration efforts have become more prevalent as the ecological processes and benefits of these systems are more understood. Ecological services provided by wetlands include flood attenuation, nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, and improved water quality. Wetlands also provide unique habitats for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Reptiles and amphibians are commonly used as indicator species in wetlands due to their increased sensitivity to environmental conditions and fast responses to change due to their short generation cycles. Through the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program, ACEP, private landowners can help protect, restore, and enhance wetlands that have been affected by agricultural uses. This project will evaluate reptile and amphibian communities in reconstructed and natural wetlands within the Red River Basin of Northeastern Texas and Northwestern Louisiana. There will be five natural wetlands sampled to create a working baseline for wetland functionality. In addition, thirty reconstructed wetlands will be sampled over a two-year period, starting February 2024. Data will be collected through visual encounters and standard trapping protocols to understand herpetofauna species and abundance.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Reptiles & Amphibians,2025,NA
58,"Spatio-temporal Patterns of Environmental Dna Detectability for the Alligator Snapping Turtle (Macrochelys temminckii), A Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Texas","Abstract: The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii), a large freshwater turtle native to the southeastern United States, is a species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) in Texas and a candidate for listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Information on its status across its range is limited because of its cryptic behavior and low detectability. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has recently emerged as a valuable and minimally-invasive tool to determine the presence of rare or cryptic species, particularly in aquatic environments. Here we present data from a 12-month sampling period of 9 sites where alligator snapping turtles are known to occur in east Texas, plus a negative control site outside of their range. Water samples were collected with abiotic measurements (including water temperature, pH, flow velocity, and dissolved oxygen), to evaluate their potential influence on eDNA detectability. The majority of positive samples came from lotic sites, with almost half of all detections occurring from October-December. On average, positive samples were collected from sites with lower temperatures, higher levels of dissolved oxygen, and higher turbidity. These results demonstrate the potential influence of environmental variables on eDNA results and what considerations are needed in predicting the presence of absence of turtles, especially in areas where they are known to be present. Results from this study may help to inform methods for a more targeted sampling effort for this species by determining optimal conditions for collecting eDNA samples, thus more accurately reflecting occurrence of alligator snapping turtles.

59,Behavioral Interactions Between Native and Non-native Ungulate Species in the Southern Great Plains,"Abstract: Non-native ungulates can have adverse effects on native ungulates, providing an opportunity to examine asymmetrical competition. We examined behavioral interactions between cattle (Bos taurus) and two native deer species: mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (O. virginianus). In March 2024, we randomly deployed 91 cameras across 7,537 ha in western Oklahoma. Across 5,551 trap nights, we recorded independent detections of cattle (n = 449), mule deer (n = 238), and white-tailed deer (n = 347). We investigated the potential for temporal niche partitioning by estimating diel activity patterns and overlap in activity (∆4) between species. Mule deer and cattle (Δ4 = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63-0.75) had similar overlap of diel activity patterns to white-tailed deer and cattle (Δ4 = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61-0.71). Cattle presence resulted in a 7% change in mule deer diel activity and a 14% change in white- tailed deer diel activity. In the absence of cattle, mule and white-tailed deer expressed more similar activity patterns (Δ4 = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88-1.0) than in the presence of cattle (Δ4 = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77-0.99). Compared to mule deer, white-tailed deer had lower diel activity overlap with cattle and responded more strongly to cattle presence. We offer evidence that cattle influence time budgets for native deer species, providing one behavioral mechanism for competition between livestock and wildlife. Understanding the mechanisms of competition is essential to identifying methods to mitigate the effects of competition and promoting compatibility between non-native and native ungulates in rangeland systems.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals IV,2025,NA
60,Weather Variables Predicting Mule Deer Parturition Timing and Birth Site Characteristics,"Abstract: The influence of environmental variables on life-history characteristics has implications for species management. Spatial variation in population performance of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) can be related to environmental variables. Our goal was to determine how weather factors 1–7 days prior to mule deer parturition affected timing throughout the reproductive season in western Oklahoma. Further, we tested how weather factors 0–12 hours prior to parturition affected timing within the diel cycle and birth site attributes. Using vaginal implant transmitters, we documented timing, location, and site characteristics of 32 parturition events. We used multiple linear regression to model weather influences on parturition timing throughout the reproductive season and birth site characteristics, and we used generalized additive models to assess parturition timing within the diel cycle. Covariates were centered and scaled. Averaging the 7 days prior to parturition, greater atmospheric pressure ( β =2.36, 95% CI=1.84–2.88) and humidity ( β =0.75, 95% CI=0.33–1.17) were predictive of birth occurring later in the reproductive season. Generally, greater average humidity in the 12 hours prior was predictive of later parturition events within the diel cycle ( β =2.61, 95% CI=0.45–4.77). Greater wind speeds were associated with birth sites characterized by shallower slopes ( β =-9.76, 95% CI=-19.35– -0.16) and less canopy cover ( β =-24.97, 95% CI=-48.93– -1.02). On windy days, birth sites with less canopy cover and slope may aid in thermal regulation and open sightlines for enhanced vigilance. Linkages between weather and the parturition process potentially shed light on behavioral strategies that could influence recruitment rates.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals IV,2025,NA
61,Spatial Ecology of Aoudad and Mule Deer: Responses to Population Management Efforts,"Abstract: The interactions between non-native aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) and native mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are poorly understood. However, they are presumed to compete at greater population densities and may shift space use to mitigate resource competition. We sought to understand how aoudad population reduction via aerial gunning affects the space use of both species. We predicted that aoudad would shift their space use to lower elevations following population reduction, increasing potential interactions with mule deer. In April 2023, we captured and collared 40 aoudad and 40 mule deer in the Chinati and Quitman Mountain ranges in the Trans-Pecos. Global Positioning System (GPS) collars were set to record locations every 2 hours. To assess aoudad and mule deer interactions, lethal aoudad removal (n= 5,773) occurred in the Chinati Mountains in August 2024. We estimated monthly space use patterns of both species using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models and compared space use pre- and post-aoudad removal. Aoudad had greater space use (ℝ?̅±SD; 5.99±3.50 km2, 5.62±3.64 km2) compared to mule deer (2.74±2.14 km2, 2.67±2.16 km2) in the Quitman and Chinati Mountains, respectively. In the Chinati Mountains, aoudad space use was similar pre- and post-aoudad removal (5.63±3.68 km2, 5.5±3.17 km2). However, mule deer reduced their range size following aoudad removal from 2.77±2.19 km2 to 1.78±1.63 km2. Results suggest these two species have differential responses to the lethal removal of aoudad. Additionally, aoudad range size remaining stationary following a removal event demonstrates that management efforts will not negatively impact areas that profit from aoudad hunting revenue.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals IV,2025,NA
62,Seasonality of Competition Potential Between Desert Bighorn and Mule Deer on Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area,"Abstract: Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area (EMWMA) supports desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), both crucial for desert ecosystems. Managing healthy populations of both species is essential due to their shared habitat and potential resource competition. However, seasonal shifts in space use by each species may exacerbate or curtail competition. Our goal was to analyze animal movements in relation to water availability and vegetation quality, examining how the movement patterns of both species shift seasonally and the extent to which their spatial distributions overlap or diverge in relation to these resources. In March 2023, we deployed Global Positioning System collars on 30 bighorn and 24 mule deer on EMWMA. We then mapped all troughs, guzzlers, tanks, and springs (n = 69). We layered the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index from satellite images for each month over the area to observe seasonality of vegetation quality. We then fit monthly Brownian bridge utilization distributions (UDs) to the movement path of each individual, and combined them to produce monthly UDs at the species level. We then modeled how each species overlaps the other monthly using the McArthur-Levins analysis. Finally, we modeled seasonality of overlap between groups with periodic beta regression models. We found evidence of seasonality in spatial overlap, with maximum overlap during July and minimum overlap during October. Our results suggest seasonality of bighorn space use is driven by social behaviors (e.g. rut) but may mitigate potential for resource competition with mule deer at EMWMA.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals IV,2025,NA
63,Is Anyone There? Resident Conspecifics Influence Behavior of Translocated Desert Bighorn Sheep,"Abstract: Translocation is a primary tool for restoring bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations to their historical range. However, ~50% of reintroductions are considered unsuccessful, necessitating investigation into behavioral strategies of sheep that increase the probability of population establishment. Our objectives were to quantify behavioral states following release and determine behavior-specific habitat selection of translocated desert bighorn sheep (O. c. mexicana) in Sonora, Mexico. We captured and fitted 16 bighorn sheep (9 females, 7 male) with GPS collars in November 2022. We used nonparametric Bayesian methods to identify latent behavioral states, validated behavioral states using social networks and video footage from collars, and predicted habitat selection using a random forest model. We identified three behavioral states: 1) unsettled and settled 2) close or 3) farther away from the release site but grouped the two settled states for further analyses. On average, female and male bighorn sheep shifted from unsettled to settled states within 4.3 days (± 1.3 SE) and 6.4 days (± 4.0 SE) after the day of translocation, respectively, which was related to when sheep integrated into native herds. Bighorn sheep selected higher elevations when in a settled state, which was not observed when in an unsettled state, because sheep were likely moving more at lower elevations to maximize the viewshed for locating resident conspecifics. Once located, sheep integrated with resident conspecifics at higher elevations. Overall, our results suggest that integration of translocated bighorn sheep into native herds will reduce search time, which may increase the probability of survival.

64,Exposure of Terrestrial Birds to Microplastic: The Effects of Ecological Traits,"Abstract: Microplastics (<5mm) have been found extensively in marine organisms including seabirds and have harmful effects on birds. Despite plastic pollution being pervasive in terrestrial ecosystems, relatively little is known about the potential exposure of terrestrial birds to microplastics. Moreover, whether bird species are differentially exposed based on ecological traits is largely unknown. This study aims to (1) investigate the exposure of terrestrial birds to microplastics by examining gastrointestinal contents and (2) explore potential relationships between microplastic exposure, diet types, and foraging strategies. Birds (n = 114) representing a broad range of distinct diet types and foraging strategies were opportunistically collected during bird-building collision surveys in Texas, including the Ruby-throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris), Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum), Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), Nashville Warbler (Leiothlypis ruficapilla), Black-and- white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), Great-tailed Grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus), House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), and White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). The esophagus through the intestines was removed from bird carcasses and digested in a 10% potassium hydroxide solution. The resulting solution was filtered and microplastics were individually extracted, characterized, and counted under a stereomicroscope. To ensure accurate identification, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to verify polymer type. Results suggest that the majority of birds assessed were exposed to microplastics, with ground-feeding birds that have omnivorous and granivorous diets ingesting the greatest quantities of microplastics. This research contributes valuable insights into the underexplored realm of microplastic exposure in terrestrial avian populations.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds IV,2025,NA
65,The Full Annual Cycle and Migration Patterns of American Kestrels Wintering in North Texas,"Abstract: Concern for declining populations of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) has triggered investigations into the patterns and challenges of their life history annual cycle. We deployed 75 Lotek PinPoint 40 GPS/VHF trackers with a remote data download function and two FlickerGPS-4-BK GSM transmitters (Cellular Tracking Technologies) on kestrels wintering in Texas. With effort, we successfully obtained the data from four kestrels (two via remote download) with Lotek devices a year or more after deployment. At least 15 other kestrels with the Lotek devices returned to their winter territories, but the download function failed. The Flicker devices transmitted location data for one full annual cycle and one spring migration route. Including one band recovery, we obtained the spring migratory route for six kestrels, breeding locations for seven kestrels, and fall migration data for three birds. The migration routes of all birds were in a north-northwesterly direction (mean = 342 degrees) and covered 640 to 1344 km (Kansas to South Dakota) distances from their wintering territories. The mean distance covered/day was 125 km in spring and 71 km/day in autumn, with 2–5- day stopovers during both the spring and fall migrations. Our data suggest some longitudinal migratory connectivity between the breeding and wintering destinations and that management of grassland habitats north of wintering ranges that facilitates the provision of adequate uncontaminated prey and suitable roost sites is a key to maintaining viable populations of American Kestrels.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds IV,2025,NA
66,Gray Hawk Nest Success and Diet in Urban and Natural Landscapes in South Texas,"Abstract: Urban development has the potential to negatively impact wildlife, including birds of prey, which occupy higher trophic levels. As urban development continues, it is important to understand how species will react to novel environments to predict how they will fare. The Gray Hawk (Buteo plagiatus) is a neotropical raptor whose range extends north into the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of south Texas. The LRGV is one of the fastest growing regions of the United States; the population of the area doubled between 1980 and 2013. Though the Gray Hawk is a widespread raptor, there is a dearth of information about the species, especially regarding the use of urban habitats and its ecology in the subtropics. This study examines breeding success and diet in urban areas in the LRGV and how they compare to nearby natural areas. During the 2023 and 2024 breeding seasons, 43 natural and 45 urban Gray Hawk nests were monitored for nest success. We found no difference in nest success between habitat types (P = 0.85). We documented and identified prey deliveries to 15 nests and found the diet of hawks nesting in urban areas differed from those nesting in natural areas (P < 0.0001). 52% of urban prey deliveries to nests consisted of avian prey, while 52% of prey deliveries to natural nests were mammals. The ability of Gray Hawks to exploit prey that is concentrated in urban areas might explain why they can survive and even have success producing young in urban landscapes.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds IV,2025,NA
67,Assessing Microplastics as an Environmental Justice Issues Through Avian Ecology and Community Engaged Research,"Abstract: The Urban Bird Project (UBP) is a transdisciplinary project that aims to assess microplastic (plastics 1mm-5mm; MP) pollution as an environmental justice issue through avian ecology and community-engaged research in San Antonio, Texas. Specifically, UBP investigates MP pollution by assessing the prevalence of MPs and their potential impacts on backyard bird breeding success across a socioeconomic gradient. We hypothesized that areas with a lower socioeconomic status would have higher burdens of MP pollution due to historical and potentially continuing discrepancies in solid waste management across neighborhoods of different socioeconomic status. Thus, we predicted that birds in lower socioeconomic status areas would face higher MP exposure compared to their conspecifics in higher socioeconomic areas. In addition, because chemicals associated with MPs act as endocrine disruptors, we predicted that these birds would experience reduced breeding success. Between March and July 2024, community scientists in three areas of the city varying with socioeconomic status hosted nestboxes and monitored breeding attempts following a modified NestWatch protocol. Permitted research team members collected nestling fecal sacs and nests to assess the exposure of birds to MPs. In contrast to our predictions, our preliminary results suggest that avian exposure to MPs does not vary across a socioeconomic gradient. Plastics in nests made up, on average, 2.5% of the total nest weight (n=19) with no significant difference between our study areas. Continuing efforts will focus on increasing sample size, assessing routes of plastic exposure, and engaging with community members to address issues of environmental justice.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Birds IV,2025,NA
68,An Assessment of Fine Scale Microclimate Conditions in Purple Martin Artificial Housing and its Influence on Productivity,"Abstract: Aerial insectivores are experiencing significant long-term population declines throughout their ranges. The eastern subspecies of Purple Martin (Progne subis subis) are particularly vulnerable as they are almost entirely dependent on provisioned artificial nesting cavities. The decline in Purple Martin populations emphasizes the importance of provisioned housing for the eastern subspecies and is crucial to the long-term conservation of the species. Our goal is to better understand the influence of microclimate (defined as temperature and relative humidity conditions inside artificial cavities) on egg and chick survival across the range of the eastern Purple Martin among six different artificial housing types and 14 study areas across the eastern United States. Our objectives to reach our goal are: 1) assess microclimate among six unique house types without the presence of nests or birds and, 2) five–seven randomly selected artificial houses with active nests at each site, 3) compare internal microclimate conditions to external, ambient conditions within objectives 1 and 2, 4) conduct weekly nest status checks per Purple Martin Conservation Association’s Project MartinWatch Citizen Science protocols. We collected approximately 1.9 million and 2.1 million temperature and relative humidity readings for objectives 1 and 2, respectively, March- August 2023, and approximately 2.5 million temperature and 1.5 million relative humidity readings for objectives 1 and 2, March-August 2024. Preliminary analyses are in progress. Our findings will enhance our understanding of Purple Martin artificial housing options and provide quantitative data to maximize nest survival for this declining species across its entire distribution.

69,Outcompeting the Invader: Enhancing Native Species in Lehmann's Lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) Dominated Rangelands,"Abstract: Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) was introduced into the U.S. for erosion control and cattle forage because of its resilience to drought, fire, and pests. However, its invasive nature often results in monocultures outcompeting native plant species, reducing biodiversity and negatively impacting wildlife. This study aims to restore native plant species and control Lehmann lovegrass in the Chihuahuan Desert. Research was conducted on Nine Point Mesa Ranch in Brewster County, Texas. We established 200 plots with four treatments: seeding (S), soil disturbance (SD), combination of both (SD+S), and control (C). Data were collected from 2022 to 2024 using line intercept transects to measure vegetation cover. Results showed that controls had more bare soil, while litter increased across treatments by winter 2023-2024. Plant diversity improved with S and SDS compared to controls. Lehmann lovegrass was the second most abundant of 23 introduced species at the site. In fall 2022 and winter 2022, and 2023, redundancy analysis showed positive native plant species and negative Lehmann lovegrass relationships across treatments, while controls had more presence of the invader. In fall 2023, native plant species and Lehmann lovegrass showed a positive relationship with S and SD+S, with the invasives keeping a positive response with controls. In winter 2023 and 2024, Lehmann lovegrass showed positive response on controls and better response to SD, while native plant species presented positive relationships with S and SD+S. Overall, S and SD+S enhanced natives competitiveness with Lehmann lovegrass, demonstrating potential for balancing restoration efforts despite the species’ persistent invasive behavior.",oral,Habitat & Wildlife Communities,2025,NA
70,Using Vegetation Communities to Compare Natural and Constructed Wetlands,"Abstract: Wetland vegetation provides an abundance of ecosystem services such as water quality regulation, flood control, and habitat space for fish, amphibians, and macroinvertebrates. Plants also act as excellent indicators of wetland conditions as dominant vegetation types are often used as biological criteria for classifying wetlands and other habitats (Cowardin & Golet, 1995). This project will assess the structure of vegetation communities in five natural wetlands and 35 constructed wetlands in the Red River drainage basin across northeastern Texas and Louisiana. The purpose of this project is to create a national-scale ecological monitoring and assessment framework for wetland structure and function using vegetation. A Relevé plot method will be used to generate a species list to conduct a Floristic Quality Assessment Index (FQAI) for each site and a Vegetation Index of Biotic Integrity (VIBI) for each dominant plant community. Data from this project will help us determine if constructed and restored wetlands are functioning as their natural counterparts.",oral,Habitat & Wildlife Communities,2025,NA
71,Are Seed Predators Filtering Mesophytic Tree Species Encroachment on Upland Sites?,"Abstract: In the southeast, fire exclusion has led to encroachment of bottomland trees species into upland forests. In addition, these species may be experiencing a release from seed predation in these upland habitats, further facilitating their establishment. We conducted a field experiment to quantify seed predation of four fire sensitive species (sweetgum, loblolly pine, red maple, and winged elm) in bottomland and upland stands in spring, summer, and fall. To explore the role of predator type (vertebrate vs. invertebrates), seeds of each species were placed in two types of containers that controlled predator access. Hardware cloth was installed on the sides of containers to exclude vertebrate predators. Red maple was predated more heavily in the uplands than the bottomlands across all seasons. In the bottomland forests, winged elm was predated more heavily than red maple. In the uplands, all three hardwoods were consumed more frequently than loblolly pine. Temporally, seed predation was highest in the summer for all species. Invertebrates were likely the primary seed predators as seed predation did not vary by container type. The warmer temperatures coupled with the low availability of seeds during the summer, may underlie intra-annual variation in seed predation. In conclusion, seed predation may actually be a barrier to establishment of bottomland hardwoods, in contrast to our hypothesis. However, loblolly pine seeds exhibited very little predation in both forest types. Restoration efforts should seek to remove seed sources of loblolly pine while implementing other management activities (e.g., prescribed fire) to restore upland forests.",oral,Habitat & Wildlife Communities,2025,NA
72,National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON): Open Data and Samples for Understanding Changing Ecosystems,"Abstract: To answer pressing questions in ecology and understand how U.S. ecosystems are changing, researchers need data collected consistently across long time scales. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and operated by Battelle, is a continental-scale observatory that collects long-term, open access ecological data from 81 field sites located across the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, and Hawaii over a 30-year timeframe. NEON collects data at both terrestrial and aquatic sites through three data collection systems: Airborne Remote Sensing, Automated Instruments, and Observational Sampling. Collection methods are standardized to ensure long-term comparability of patterns and processes spatially and temporally. All samples and data collected by NEON are publicly available and can be accessed digitally through the NEON website. By providing free and open standardized data—along with data analysis tools, tutorials, and educational resources—NEON is engaged in the global effort to expand the scope of science and make scientific data access easier for all. This presentation will introduce NEON and demonstrate the resources available to access and use NEON data and samples for research, curriculum development, or land management.

73,Understanding Seasonal Phenology and Community Composition of Aerial Invertebrates in Rio Grande Wild Turkey Habitat in the Edwards Plateau Ecoregion,"Abstract: The watersheds of the North and South Llano River supports diverse aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, while providing freshwater to major urban areas, sustaining ranching industry, and facilitating outdoor recreation. This region is also home to the greatest densities of Rio Grande Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia; RGWT) in Texas. While aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate communities likely contribute to RGWT nutrition, aerial invertebrates associated with RGWT nesting and brood-rearing activities remain unknown. We examined species’ availability, community composition, phenologies, and biomass of aerial invertebrate communities in upland and riparian RGWT habitats. Within these habitats, invertebrate communities were systematically sampled along 40 m transects located on the South Llano River and North Llano River, from April to July in 2023 and 2024. These two river systems exhibit contrasting flows, with the south fork being perennial and the north fork intermittent with extended periods of zero flow. Preliminary results show that riparian habitats support higher invertebrate biomass and diversity than upland sites. Distinct seasonal peaks in abundances were observed for Hexagenia spp. and lepidopteran species, which aligned with RGWT mating seasonality. Our findings improve what is known about invertebrate communities co-occurring with RGWT in our study region, which supports further studies to determine potential food resources for RGWT among two key habitats.

74,Charisma and Texas Waterbirds: What’s the impact?,"Abstract: Charismatic megafauna tend to receive increased focus from research and funding due to their aesthetic and eliciting an emotional response from observers. However, not all species are afforded equal standing in the eyes of wildlife officials or the public. Waterbirds are island-dwelling birds that are not considered charismatic but critically important to coastal ecosystem health. Yet, subjective judgments about waterbirds based on appearance may be detrimental to their viability because a lack of long-term investments made by critical actors. To further understand how charisma relates to waterbird conservation, we developed a tripartite conceptual model to examine drivers of pro-waterbird conservation as a function of charisma. We examined the drivers of intended behavior underlying recreational disturbance to waterbirds on the Texas coast, home to over 200 species of waterbirds. We surveyed Texas coastal recreationists via intercept, email, and postal mail. Results from 615 completed surveys indicate that likeability of waterbirds did not significantly impact stated compliance. The belief there are a sufficient regulations for waterbirds had a significant negative impact on indicated compliance. Therefore, the belief that there are enough regulations for waterbirds leads people to be less willing to comply, indicating a feeling of overregulation. Additionally, those recreating longer in an area were more likely to follow regulations. Waterbird managers can utilize this information to foster a culture of compliance with long-term recreationists invested in protecting the resource for continued use. Through the investment of recreationists, wildlife agencies can have effective long-term management and reduce bird decline in Texas.",oral,Human Dimensions/Conservation Communication/Entomology,2025,NA
75,Urban Wildlife Information Network,"Abstract: The Urban Wildlife Information Network (UWIN) was established in 2017 by the Lincoln Park Zoo’s Urban Wildlife Institute. Since then, UWIN has expanded into an international network focused on collecting urban wildlife camera trap data for use among its partners, including Fort Worth, Austin, Houston, and El Paso. The objective of the UWIN network is to gather camera trap data from participating cities to develop, grow, and compare data across the network, uncovering patterns and differences in animal ecology and behavior along the rural to urban gradient. Data is collected seasonally through camera traps that are set in the same location four times per year: January, April, July, and October. Cameras are spaced approximately 1km apart, set up at the beginning of each survey month, and collected at the end of each survey month. The data are uploaded to the UWIN database, where photos are tagged and made available for the UWIN partners’ research. According to the UWIN website, 25 papers, including graduate and undergraduate research, have been published using the UWIN database. These studies examine topics such as wildlife distribution across urban landscape, how wildlife interact with humans, and the impact of human activities on urban wildlife populations. The findings can then be applied to urban planning, design, and wildlife management, helping cities become part of the solution to the biodiversity crisis.",oral,Human Dimensions/Conservation Communication/Entomology,2025,NA
76,Toward Coexistence: Exploring Human Dimensions of Mountain Lion Management in Texas,"Abstract: Mountain lion (Puma concolor) is an apex predator in north America. Although its national status is ""least concern"" its population status varies across its range. In Texas, lions are considered a “non-game” species meaning the state has very little in place to monitor their abundance and distribution. Should the state consider more active engagement in mountain management, an understanding of the drivers of Texas residents’ preferences for managing mountain lions would be needed. We administered an online questionnaire through Qualtrics residents from across the state (n = 1,069). Our objective was to assess how wildlife value orientations (WVOs), coexistence, attitudes, trust, and perceived risk influence respondents’ preferences for managing mountain lion interactions across 11 scenarios. Our modeling results revealed respondents tended to perceive less risk if they had a more positive attitude toward mountain lions. Also, if they were more mutualist in their WVO, they were more accepting of coexistence measures. We also observed that if a mountain lion was reported to have attacked a person or attacked livestock, mutualist respondents preferred non-lethal option (e.g., do nothing). However, traditionalist respondents were more accepting of killing mountain lions. Before implementing a more engaged management plan for mountain lions, it would be wise for the state to understand factors that shape residents’ attitudes toward mountain lion management.",oral,Human Dimensions/Conservation Communication/Entomology,2025,NA

The Texas A&M Natural Resources Institute’s Texas Land Trends program has informed state agencies, land managers, citizens and other decision-makers about our state’s working lands and has served to guide conservation efforts and natural resource policy development over the last 25 years. With 25-years of trend data, this 5-year report, in its sixth iteration, provides essential insights into the ongoing transformation of population growth, land value, ownership patterns, and land uses across the state. Shifting economies and new industry opportunities, byproducts of the global pandemic, magnified the downward trajectory of working land loss in our state. The last five years have seen continued loss in working lands and population increases unlike any other period. Through the power of a “good map”, the Texas Land Trends program provides insights to these key issues and examines the latest trends in urban development and working land loss to better understand changes to Texas rural landscapes.",oral,Human Dimensions/Conservation Communication/Entomology,2025,NA
78,Lizards and Legends: Culture and Komodo Dragon Conservation,"Abstract: Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis), the largest extant lizard species with the smallest home range of any large carnivore, face growing conservation challenges due to habitat loss, human encroachment, and climate change. While ecological factors are well-studied, the intricate relationship between humans and Komodo dragons within Komodo National Park remains relatively underexplored. We will explore how cultural and social factors shape island communities' perspectives on Komodo dragons, their conservation, and how these perspectives, in turn, influence the species and their environment. Our research will examine the interconnectedness of culture, conservation, and ecosystem health through the reciprocal relationship between humans and Komodo dragons. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we will conduct quantitative surveys to assess attitudes toward Komodo dragons and their conservation, and qualitative semi-structured interviews to uncover deeper cultural insights. We will conduct a thematic analysis of interview data and a statistical analysis of survey responses to reveal nuanced differences and similarities in community perspectives and how cultural narratives and social structures shape human-Komodo dragon interactions. Our findings will contribute to a culturally informed framework for conservation strategies that integrate local knowledge, promote coexistence, and support the well-being of Komodo dragons and their habitat. Our research will bridge ecological and sociocultural perspectives to address critical research gaps and promote a holistic understanding of Komodo dragon conservation. It will emphasize the importance of empowering local voices to create inclusive and sustainable conservation strategies.",oral,Human Dimensions/Conservation Communication/Entomology,2025,NA
79,Arachnid Response to Erosion Control Blankets: An Experimental Approach,"Abstract: Erosion control blankets (ECBs) are used along roadsides that receive heavy soil and vegetation disturbance. These products consist of nettings made from plastic or natural materials that remain in the environment as vegetation regrows. Although anecdotal observations suggest that small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians can become entangled or entrapped in ECBs, little information exists regarding the threat to invertebrates. Our objective was to evaluate how ECBs might impact arachnids, particularly tarantulas (Aphonopelma) and whipscorpions (Mastigoproctus giganteus) in Texas; although not designated as species of concern in Texas, arachnids are experiencing declines at global scales due to habitat fragmentation, urbanization, and overharvest in exotic pet trade, prompting a need to explore mechanisms of decline at local and regional scales. We obtained 12 ECBs with differing materials, netting, and matrix. We conduct two behavioral tests associated with movement across the ECBs, free-roaming and coerced. For our trials we place 12 tarantulas and 4 vinegarroons, individually within an experimental arena (3.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 m) and record behavior (e.g., avoidance, burrowing, impediment to movement, degree of entanglement). We recorded body and appendage measurements to evaluate morphological relationships associated with behavior and measurements of the ECBs. From preliminary free- roaming trials, we observed 3 tarantula entanglements, 14 impediments to movement of tarantulas. Vinegarroons have exhibited no negative movement responses. This study is part of a larger study that includes other species, tensile strength, and biodegradation tests that aim to increase our understanding of the risk of ECBs to wildlife in Texas.",oral,Human Dimensions/Conservation Communication/Entomology,2025,NA
80,Assessment of Graminoid Floral Resources to Enhance Habitat for Social and Solitary Bees in North-Central Texas,"Abstract: Projected increases in climate and weather stochasticity in the Southern Great Plains over the coming decades are likely to result in an increase in drought pressure throughout the region. As a result, flowering dicots may decrease production of floral resources, resulting in increased food scarcity for many pollinators. Our study seeks to assess the resource quality and availability of drought-tolerant forage, in particular flowering grasses within family Poaceae (grasses). Warm-season grasses, both native and nonnative, have adaptations which confer drought resistance and allow plant growth and floral production to persist under water stress. Anecdotal cases exist for the utilization of grass pollen by pollinator insects, but forage quality and composition has not been assessed. In this study, we plan to assess the pollen quality of big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), and Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense) as common and abundant roadside grasses throughout the region. We will collect pollen from our target taxa and utilize Fourier- transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to assess nutrient composition. This will be paired with feeding trials in four Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) hives in order to understand the impacts of grass pollen feed on bee health in context. We seek to provide a basis for quantifying the feasibility for grass pollen as forage for pollinating insects which can then inform management and planting practices within Texas grasslands and pocket prairies to promote pollinator health and resilience under projected water deficits for the climate of the Southern Great Plains.",oral,Human Dimensions/Conservation Communication/Entomology,2025,NA
81,Using Targeted Poisoning of Red Imported Fire Ants to Improve Texas Horned Lizard (Phrynosoma Cornutum) Habitat,"Abstract: The spread of red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta; RIFA) has often been included as one of the drivers of the decline of the Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum; THL). There have been two primary hypotheses for this: 1) direct lizard mortality at the hands of RIFA, and 2) displacement of their main food source, harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex spp.) by RIFA. A third hypothesis suggests that the invasion of RIFA could be causing a decline in hatchling THL food resource. Hatchling THL are too small to consume Pogonomyrmex and must rely on smaller species of ants for food. Many studies have attempted widespread treatment of RIFA, however this could have unintended consequences for non-target ant species THL depend on for food. Using a targeted application method, I sought to directly reduce RIFA populations while minimizing poison exposure to non-target ants. Experiments were conducted over the summers of 2022 and 2023 at four sites located at Mason Mountain Wildlife Management in central Texas, a locality with an ongoing THL reintroduction program. Poisons were applied monthly May – August in 2022 and 2023. Effects of each targeted poisoning were evaluated using hot dog baits and pitfall traps. Pitfall trapping was likely a more accurate estimate of ant abundance and revealed that treatment decreased RIFA abundance for both years and had variable effects on hatchling THL prey abundance. In 2024 - 2026, I am continuing this research with the primary objective of seeing how horned lizard survival varies between poisoned and non-poisoned sites.

82,Seasonal and Spatial Variation of Bat Communities in Texas,"Abstract: Bats are diverse and face many natural and human-induced threats, making this taxon ideal bioindicators of anthropogenic change. Texas’s large size and diverse habitats and weather conditions make it a model system for our goal of assessing bat community responses to seasonal and spatial variation. Texas is also at an intersection of two main threats to bats, white-nose syndrome and wind turbines. We deployed acoustic detectors at 97 sites across the state from Fall 2020 to Summer 2023 and used a combination of manual vetting and automatic classification to identify species. We divided Texas into eight ecoregions representing distinct habitats and combined seasons across the three years. Additionally, we examined bat community composition in relation to landcover at three spatial scales, 10 km, 25 km, and 50 km. Weather differed among season and ecoregion and landcover among ecoregion. Bat diversity was greatest in summer (H=1.789) and lowest in early spring (H=1.214); diversity was greatest in the Pineywoods (H=1.865) and lowest in the Cross Timbers (H=1.102). Species richness was similar among seasons (R=17-18) but varied among ecoregions (R=8-15). Bat communities differed in winter from spring and summer (p-value<0.001) and among most ecoregions (p-value<0.001). Of the three spatial scales, landcover at 25 km explained the most model variance with most variance explained by ecoregion and season, followed by barren, urban, forest, and crop. Results serve as baseline data in bat community composition that can be used for conservation and management as white-nose syndrome and wind energy development continue to threaten Texas bats.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals V,2025,NA
83,Investigating Bat Drinking Activity in Response to Variability in Water Surface Area,"Abstract: Biodiversity in urban areas provides essential ecosystem services, yet cities are often not designed to support wildlife. To encourage a diversity of wildlife, the resources they require must be available and accessible. Water is an essential resource for wildlife, but the availability and accessibility of water sources vary, particularly between taxa. For example, bats access water sources on the wing by swooping down to the surface of the water to drink. Therefore, the accessibility of water sources by bats may be influenced by the surface area. This study investigated the relationship between water surface area and bat drinking activity at six ponds in Fort Worth, Texas. Using a drone to record aerial views of each survey site, we determined four surface area metrics that could influence bat drinking activity: 1) fundamental surface area, 2) realized surface area, 3) maximum patch size, and 4) longest continuous stretch. We conducted behavioral observation and acoustic monitoring surveys to record bat activity at each survey site. We found that the longest continuous stretch showed the strongest positive relationships with bat activity, specifically drinking activity. We found that clutter, such as algae, litter, and vegetation, fragmented the water's surface, creating patches with shorter stretches of water that hindered bat drinking activity. Thus, surface area did influence water accessibility, highlighting that long continuous stretches of water uninterrupted by clutter would encourage bat drinking activity. Therefore, the removal of clutter has the potential to support an abundance and diversity of bats and aid in their conservation.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals V,2025,NA
84,Reducing Bat-Turbine Collision Risk While Optimizing Wind Energy Production,"Abstract: Around the globe, wind turbine-related bat mortality is a conservation challenge for wildlife managers and the wind energy industry. These mortalities are an important issue for threatened and endangered bat species and may threaten population persistence of the common and widespread hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus). Given the increasing demand for wind energy to meet decarbonization goals, coupled with increasing evidence that bats are attracted to wind turbines, developing cost- effective and practical impact minimization strategies is imperative. “Smart curtailment” strategies incorporate site-specific information to identify high-risk periods for bats, with the potential to provide more conservation value for less power loss compared to traditional blanket curtailment methods. Optimized Smart Curtailment (OSC), developed by WEST, reduces bat fatalities while maximizing power production by curtailing wind turbines when a Bayesian decision tree model indicates higher risk conditions for bats and lower energy production potential. In this talk, we will present an analysis of OSC model runs and demonstrate a cost-benefit analysis at an operating wind facility. We will also highlight key considerations when implementing smart curtailment and discuss the evolving regulatory context and acceptance surrounding this strategy.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals V,2025,NA
85,Validating a Bat Fatality Detection System at Wind Turbines,"Abstract: Researchers investigating conditions associated with bat fatalities at wind turbines have historically used nocturnal video monitoring focused on the rotor swept area (RSA) to detect the moment of fatality. However, detecting a bat fatality in the RSA is difficult for a variety of reasons, and traditional equipment and analyses have been cost prohibitive reducing the feasibility for some facilities to conduct such studies. Our objective was to test and validate a cost-effective camera technology with a field of view (FOV) aimed below the RSA to measure the exact timing of bat fatalities occurring at wind turbines. This study was meant as a proof-of-concept to validate the system could capture and identify the data stated above for widespread use in future research related to minimization strategies. We equipped two wind turbines in Zapata County, Texas with two Axis Q1952-E thermal ground-based camera systems each with the FOV below the RSA. Videos were processed with a proprietary machine learning algorithm to detect bats that fell to the ground, presumably from being struck by a blade. We further conducted post-construction bat fatality monitoring at these turbines four days a week from July 15th to October 31st, 2022 for comparison to the camera system detections. Overall, the thermal camera system detection rate was 88.5% when compared to human searchers. An unanticipated result of our study was high bat activity rates previously undocumented in the airspace below the RSA, an important observation for minimization strategies. This system is optimal for research at wind turbines, particularly offshore.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals V,2025,NA
86,White-Nose Syndrome Impacts on Myotis velifer Populations in Central Texas,"Abstract: White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease caused by the psychrophilic fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans that affects hibernating bats. Since its discovery in North America, millions of bats have died and it remains one of the most pressing conservation issues of our time. In March of 2020, a mass mortality event of cave myotis (Myotis velifer) was attributed to WNS throughout Central Texas. We quantify population declines of cave myotis at several Central Texas maternity roosts compared to historic counts after the confirmation of WNS. In four of the five roosts, cave myotis numbers have declined by over 90% compared to historic counts. The population declines presented herein – combined with anecdotal evidence from several other southwestern states – stress the need and urgency to assess the conservation status of cave myotis. Continued surveys and WNS surveillance at known winter and summer roosts across the species’ range will be imperative to tracking the potentially cryptic population declines, and the discovery of new roosts (particularly in WNS- negative regions) should be prioritized to facilitate the collection of baseline population data and to inform recovery efforts.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals V,2025,NA
87,"Daytime Hurricane Arrival Changes Daytime, but not Nighttime Mammal Activity","Abstract: The impact of natural disasters on urban mammals is poorly understood. This study aimed to find out how a hurricane affects urban mammal activity. We hypothesized that mammal activity would decrease as a hurricane approached and resume after the eye passed over. Thirty five camera traps were deployed in parks, cemeteries, golf courses, and nature preserves along two transects stretching southeast and northeast from the center of Houston. We compared mammal activity in the period from 48 hrs before until 48 hrs after the passage of Hurricane Beryl on July 8, 2024 to activity during the same time period in 2023. The eye of Hurricane Beryl passed over Hobby Airport at approximately 1400 hr on July 8, 2024. Fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) and Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) were hardly detected during the day before the hurricane. Compared to the same time period in 2023, both squirrel species delayed activity until several hours after the hurricane passed. Raccoon (Procyon lotor), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp), and opossum (Didelphis virginiana) activity during the nights before and after Hurricane Beryl was similar to the same time period in 2023. The short-term impact of a hurricane on mammal activity may depend on whether it arrives during the active period of a particular species.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals V,2025,NA
88,Novel Survey Methodology for One of North America’s Most Elusive Mammals,"Abstract: Historically, the Texas kangaroo rat (Dipodomys elator; TKR) was known from 11 counties in Texas and two in Oklahoma. Currently, it is believed to occur only in five counties in Texas. The reduction in their geographic range is thought to be a result of declining population levels, driven by anthropogenic factors leading to habitat fragmentation and degradation. In 2016 and 2017 surveys along 2,371 km and 1,348 km of county roads resulted in 96 and 78 TKR detections, respectively. Subsequently, in 2024, similar surveys for TKR during August along ~58 km of county roads resulted in 6 TKR detections. In response to the low TKR detections during road surveys, we tested a new survey methodology in which we used thermal monoculars to conduct point counts for TKR. We conducted 5-minute point counts at 74 points spaced 200 meters apart, over the course of 26 nights. This resulted in a total of 63 detections on 31 of our 74 points. We used the package Distance in R to estimate detection probability and incorporated environmental covariates. The results indicated a detection probability of 0.39, a density estimate of 0.10 individuals per ha, and an estimated 158 individual TKR within the 1,499 ha sampled area. We then used general additive models in the package dsm in R to generate a density surface model to extrapolate the density of TKR beyond the sampled region. This resulted in a modeled estimate of 248 individuals within the 2,392 ha study area.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals V,2025,NA
89,Evaluating Small Mammal Biodiversity Using Camera Traps,"Abstract: The small mammal community within the Post Oak Savanna Ecoregion of the Ecological and Natural Resource Teaching Area at Texas A&M University has been historically understudied. Despite the forthcoming management interventions aimed at combating woody encroachment through techniques like fire, herbicide, and mechanical removal, little is known about the composition of this small mammal community. Our research aims to fill this gap by establishing an efficient survey method for small mammal richness and diversity in correlation to different land cover types. In our pilot study, we deployed ten modified bucket camera traps, each equipped with two cameras: one facing downward and the other outward. Half of these traps were baited to investigate potential increases in detection compared to un-baited sites. Preliminary findings indicate a greater detection rate for baited sites among species such as white- footed mice, armadillos, fox squirrels, and opossums. By extending the duration of our study and expanding the number of baited camera trap sites, we aim to comprehensively assess small mammal richness and diversity before and after the implementation of management practices. Through this approach, we expect to observe changes within site occupancy, richness, and diversity of small mammal communities in this Post Oak Savanna and how the small mammal community responds to woody encroachment management, offering contributions to the ecological understanding and conservation strategies in similar ecosystems.",oral,Conservation & Ecology of Mammals V,2025,NA
90,Influence of Small-mammal Herbivory on Rangeland Restoration Success in Western Texas,"Abstract: Rangeland restoration is an important tool for recovering rangeland health. Restoration is conducted to improve biodiversity, ecological integrity, and ecosystem resilience. Restoration success can be hindered by overgrazing from herbivores, climate change, desertification, and invasive species. A factor that has not been considered in past studies is the herbivory of small mammals (e.g., Lepus californicus and Rodentia) on rangeland restoration efforts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of small-mammals herbivory on rangeland restoration success in western Texas. Specifically, our objectives were 1) to identify the relative abundance of small mammals in the restored rangelands in western Texas, and 2) to evaluate the influence of small mammal herbivory on plant species composition, richness and biomass in western Texas. I established 40 small mammal enclosures (n = 40) on 2 rangeland restoration sites located within Ector (Goldsmith site) and Gaines (Seminole site) counties of western Texas. Small mammals exclosures were established within subplots that received a restoration treatment consisting of a high diversity + cover mix. We collected species composition and biomass within small herbivore exclosures and matching control points to quantify evidence of small mammals’ herbivory at the restoration sites. We also conducted rodents trapping by using Sherman traps to identify rodent species composition and burrow counts for rodent relative abundance within restoration sites. Preliminary results indicated that herbivory by small mammals exerts great pressure on rangelands restoration success. In conclusion, herbivory by small mammals can be considered in strategic planning for sustainable rangeland restoration success.

91,"Different Drivers, Same Tick: Effect of Host Traits, Habitat, And Climate on the Infestation of Peromyscus leucopus and Onychomys leucogaster by Larval Dermacentor Ticks","Abstract: Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) pose a growing concern for both public and wildlife health. Understanding how host traits and environmental factors influence tick infestation in small mammals is critical for improving TBD management strategies. We investigated the prevalence and load of Dermacentor spp. larvae on two rodent species: Peromyscus leucopus and Onychomys leucogaster, in the arid brushland ecosystem of South Texas. We used generalized linear models to quantify how host, habitat structure, and climatic variables impact tick presence and load. Our results show that different drivers influenced tick infestation across species; O. leucogaster experienced higher tick loads in smaller individuals and habitats with more leaf litter, whereas P. leucopus was more susceptible to ticks during reproductive periods, particularly at temperatures between 15–23°C. These findings highlight the importance of considering species- specific interactions between host traits and environmental factors for the study of the dynamics of ticks and rodents. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence on the complexity of tick-rodent host dynamics and offer insights for predicting changes in parasitism patterns and managing wildlife health in response to a changing environment in South Texas.",oral,Wildlife Disease & Toxicology,2025,NA
92,Impact of Short Versus Long Prescribed Burning Intervals on Tick Density in Southern Texas Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes Ecoregion,"Abstract: In southern Texas, prescribed fire is used to improve forage for livestock, prevent wildfires, and combat woody encroachment. Additionally, fire may serve as a method to suppress the abundance of pest species [TJ1] such as ticks. Studies on prescribed fire as a tick control method are limited, especially in this region; therefore, this study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of prescribed fires in decreasing tick density and tick-borne pathogen abundance. We hypothesize that tick density and pathogen abundance? will be reduced by prescribed burning, and that shorter, 3-year fire return intervals be more effective at reducing ticks than longer, 5-year return intervals. This study uses three randomly assigned prescribed fire treatments on ≥200 ha patches in the Gulf Prairies and Marshes ecoregion: winter short-interval burns, winter long-interval burns, and non-burned control treatments, each with two replicates. The vegetation in each patch is sampled monthly for questing ticks via dragging a 1-m2 cloth across two landscape types: around tree mottes (n = 3-4 per patch) and through open range (n = 2 × 750 m2 transects per patch). Woody tree mottes are expected to support higher tick density due to both high host-utilization, and more favorable microhabitat conditions including increased shade and moisture. After collection, ticks will be identified to species and screened for pathogens. Results of this study will help to determine if prescribed fire is an effective component of integrated tick management in southern TX, and will inform rangeland managers of best fire-based practices for tick control.",oral,Wildlife Disease & Toxicology,2025,NA
93,Nilgai Antelope Are Not Susceptible to Infection with the Causative Agents of Bovine Babesiosis,"Abstract: In the mid-1950s cattle fever ticks (CFT), Rhipicephalus microplus and R. annulatus, vectors of bovine babesiosis-causing parasites, were considered eradicated from the US except for a permanent quarantine zone along the Texas-Mexico border. Nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are a common alternative host for CFT. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the role that nilgai antelope may play in the transmission of bovine babesiosis-causing parasites. The objective of this research was to evaluate susceptibility of nilgai antelope to infection with Babesia sp. and to assess their propensity to serve as sources of infections for tick vectors. We hand reared nilgai antelope calves to 4-5 months of age and then challenged them via intravenous inoculation with virulent strains of Babesia bovis or B. bigemina. Nilgai calves and control beef calves were assessed for clinical signs of infection by measuring PCV and body temperature, as well as molecularly via PCR and serology. In vivo and in vitro inoculation and culturing provided further evidence that nilgai are not susceptible to infection with either Babesia sp. Given the overlapping habitat of these alternative hosts with primary cattle hosts, it is imperative to understand the impacts of these exotic species, which are a new addition to the ecology and epidemiology of this disease system. Although nilgai may not be susceptible to infection with bovine babesiosis-causing parasites, it is crucial to continue to develop alternative treatments to treat nilgai and other wildlife for CFT infestations to prevent the spread of this economically important livestock pest.",oral,Wildlife Disease & Toxicology,2025,NA
94,Talkin’ Toxo: T. gondii seroprevalence and Demographic Impacts on White- tailed Deer in South Texas,"Abstract: Toxoplasmosis (causative agent Toxoplasma gondii) is a zoonotic disease that causes significant morbidity in animals and humans. In wildlife, T. gondii infection may influence reproduction and behavior, including induced abortion, increased aggression, and abnormal movement; however, prevalence and sublethal impacts are poorly understood. To investigate T. gondii influence on white-tailed deer population dynamics, we used four years of biological and known fate data from a deer population in South Texas to determine T. gondii prevalence and survival of does and their offspring as a function of doe serostatus. Serology revealed 29 of 59 (49%) does had a titer of ≥1:25 on a modified agglutination test, and were considered seropositive for T. gondii. From 2020-2023, Kaplan-Meier annual survival of seropositive and seronegative does ranged from 70-100% and 85-100%, respectively. Adult survival was high except in 2022, a year with harsh winter and drought conditions, when survival of seropositive does was lower than that of seronegative does (70% vs. 85%, respectively). Across all years, survival of fawns from seropositive and seronegative does did not differ. However, in 2021, a year with above average rain, fawns born to seropositive does had lower survival (20% vs 46%). These trends suggest that T. gondii infection may compound the effects of external stressors on adult white-tailed deer when conditions are poor, but have a more noticeable influence on fawn survival when conditions are optimal. Further understanding of sublethal effects of T. gondii infection is needed to assess potential impact on survival and recruitment in wildlife populations.",oral,Wildlife Disease & Toxicology,2025,NA
95,Assessing Potential Biases Introduced by Common Assumptions in Chronic Wasting Disease Predictive Modeling,"Abstract: Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease that infects some members of the Cervidae family. Agent-based models (ABM) are a common tool used to simulate and predict CWD dynamics to inform management decisions; however, despite the complexity of both CWD and host behavior, ABMs often make broad assumptions about these processes. We evaluated the magnitude of biases introduced by common assumptions made in ABMs used for CWD. We developed a baseline ABM for the Texas Panhandle CWD area using data collected from GPS-collared juvenile (n = 29) and adult (n = 146) mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) throughout the Texas Panhandle following the same assumptions as in previously published ABMs. We then expanded upon our baseline model to create three additional ABMs that each addressed one current knowledge limitation or assumption: (1) inclusions of exploratory juvenile movement, (2) addressing differences in host movement post-infection, and (3) including all three CWD-susceptible species found in the region with species-specific movement parameters. The baseline and the model incorporating host movement post- infection had negligible differences, with prevalence ranging between 0.4% and 3.0%. In contrast, the three-species model had multiple peaks in prevalence throughout the year with maximum prevalence reaching 8.3%. The exploratory juvenile movement model had a steady increase in prevalence throughout the year with a maximum of 32.1%. These findings highlight the importance of testing and refining common assumptions in ABMs for CWD as incorporating empirical field data on often-ignored processes can substantially alter predictions of disease prevalence across space or time.",oral,Wildlife Disease & Toxicology,2025,NA
96,Let’s Talk Sh…poop! Assessment of Endoparasitism in Free-ranging Felids of Southern Texas,"Abstract: Parasites have varying physiological effects on their hosts including reduced nutrient absorption, decreased blood cell activity, and damage to host tissues. These impacts from parasite presence can be compounded by other internal (e.g., genetic inbreeding) and external (e.g., environmental) factors, which may increase morbidity. In southern Texas, the last remaining populations of the nationally endangered ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) persist. These populations exhibit low genetic diversity and are susceptible to stochastic events (e.g., drought), but no baseline understanding of health risks from disease and parasitism exists. Other sympatric species exist in this landscape, including bobcats (Lynx rufus), which may harbor and share parasites with ocelots. Our objectives for this ongoing study are to determine endoparasite profiles and identify parasites of greatest concern for these two wild felid species. Further, we aim to understand the overlap of parasite communities between bobcats and ocelots. Fecal flotation was conducted on 48 felids (ocelots, n=17; bobcats, n=31) spanning four years (2019-2022). Helminths were observed in 100% of ocelots and 94% of bobcats, while protozoa were observed in 59% of ocelots and 55% of bobcats sampled. Skin mites (Demodex spp.) were coincidentally found in 18% of ocelots and 35% of bobcats, suggesting ingestion during grooming. The most common intestinal parasites observed were the helminths Toxascaris leonina (roundworm) and Ancylostoma spp. (hookworm), both of which are considered pathogenic in felines. These findings provide a better understanding of the felid population’s susceptibility to parasitism and assist in planning strategies that aid in reducing or preventing transmission of parasites.",oral,Wildlife Disease & Toxicology,2025,NA
97,Using Animal Movement Models to Understand Potential Disease Transmission Dynamics Among Wild Felids,"Abstract: Disease can have profound impacts on wildlife populations, and insights into animal movement are important for understanding disease spread. Integrated step selection analysis (iSSA) simultaneously estimates movement and resource selection and explicitly incorporates information about velocities, turning angles, and environmental covariates that may affect movement and selection. Our research investigates the space use of sympatric ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) and bobcats (Lynx rufus) on a private ranch in South Texas, as well as the implications of this space use on potential disease transmission. Our hypothesis is that the generalist bobcat is using a wider range of habitats compared to the federally endangered ocelot, a dense canopy specialist, and that bobcats could be serving as a vector of ocelot disease transmission. We used iSSA to estimate movement and resource selection of ocelots and bobcats and hypothesized that certain environmental covariates (e.g., habitat type, percent canopy cover, distance to highway) would impact these processes. We found that while both species select for thornscrub habitat, bobcats are also found in more open habitat. These findings have important implications for disease transmission dynamics, and will lead to future research into the directionality of disease transmission among sympatric felids.",oral,Wildlife Disease & Toxicology,2025,NA
98,The Influence of Distance to Water on Oral Rabies Vaccine Bait Consumption in the South Texas Plains,"Abstract: Oral Rabies Vaccine (ORV) baits have been aerially dropped along the US- Mexico border since 1995 for canine rabies. However, there is little information on the fate of baits once they are deployed across the landscape. Because the vaccine in these baits is only stable for a short window of time, it is important to understand how many baits are consumed during the timeframe they are viable. Our goal is to determine the influence of distance to water on ORV bait consumption by coyotes or non-target species once the bait is deployed in the South Texas Plains. We used ArcGIS Pro to generate eight 25 ha grids with 18 camera traps in each grid. We hand applied one ORV bait per camera trap site in two grids per each application trip. We collected data from 144 camera trap sites for roughly four consecutive weeks during each calendar season on the East Foundation’s San Antonio Viejo Ranch. We generated a logistic regression and used Tukey’s HSD to do a pairwise comparison of water centered vs randomly generated grids. We found that there was not a significant difference in ORV bait consumption at water centered grids vs randomly generated grids(p<0.5). The results from this study will help better inform ORV programs management practices for future ORV deployments.",oral,Wildlife Disease & Toxicology,2025,NA
99,Quail and Parasitic Helminths: Status of Knowledge and Should We Be Concerned?,"Abstract: North American quail have been experiencing population declines likely due to habitat loss and changing weather. However, even in areas with ample habitat and years of above-average precipitation, quail populations still exhibit below-expected abundance. Parasitic helminths, such as eyeworms (Oxyspirura petrowi) and cecal worms (Aulonocephalus pennula), have been hypothesized as potential contributors to quail declines. A general trend arising from over a decade of research suggests that a spatial gradient exists in eyeworm prevalence, with prevalence decreasing from northern Texas to southern Texas, and no such gradient observed for cecal worms. Beyond this spatial trend, no study has searched for other trends in the data differentiating northern and southern Texas. We conducted a meta-analysis to explore quail parasitism trends between northern and southern Texas. We collated a 10-year dataset (2007‒2019) of hunter-harvested and live-trapped northern bobwhites and scaled quail using raw data from past studies. Histograms of prevalence (% infected) and intensity (no. worms/infected bird) were generated by region and through time. Our data supported the spatial gradient in eyeworm prevalence between northern (54%) and southern (4%) Texas; however, intensity was low in both regions (most birds infected with <10 worms). Prevalence of cecal worms was relatively high in both regions (65% northern Texas and 81% southern Texas), as well as intensity (few birds possessing low worm burdens <10). These data call into question whether eyeworms should be of greater concern than cecal worms.

100,"Conservation Without Borders: Research on Desert Bighorn Sheep, Carmen Mountain White-tailed Deer, and Elk in Mexico","Abstract: Transboundary wildlife conservation is extremely challenging yet crucial for species that span across international borders because of habitat loss, security issues, and resource disparities. Effective conservation requires detailed ecological knowledge and collaboration to manage large mammal species that have large ranges, thus potentially crossing political boundaries and impacting conservation efforts. The story is no different in Mexico, which is rich with species diversity, but lacks detailed knowledge and information to effectively conserve ecologically and economically important species. Recently, we developed a binational collaboration between Mexico and the United States to conserve and manage large mammal species in Mexico. We focus our research and conservation efforts on desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana), Carmen Mountain white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus carminis), and elk (Cervus canadensis). These projects aim to enhance our understanding of movement ecology, habitat use, and population dynamics with the goal of developing conservation strategies to manage mobile species across their ranges, and that can cross jurisdictional boundaries. While the United States has a long history of wildlife research and more established conservation programs, similar efforts in Mexico have been fewer, leading to knowledge gaps that hinder effective cross-border conservation. These projects will contribute to a holistic approach to wildlife management and cross- border conservation. The findings will enhance conservation strategies and efforts essential for the protection of these species and their habitats. Additionally, this collaboration can be a model for future, international research and how to engage landowners with research to help meet their conservation goals.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
101,"An Introduction to the Native and Non-native Plant-insect Interactions and Potential Pollinators of Puerto Williams and Yendegaia, Cabo de Hornos, Chile","Abstract: The Magellanic sub-Antarctic ecoregion of southern Chile represents one of the last remaining pristine areas on Earth, but there are knowledge gaps concerning the biodiversity and interactions of the regions’ flora and fauna. The Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve contains a wealth of native biodiversity but is also now home to many non- native species that have been introduced to the area. Non-native insect species like Bombus terrestris and Vespula vulgaris are known to have detrimental influence on native populations through competition for resources/nesting habitat, larvae predation, and foreign pathogen introduction. However, their interactions with the native and non- native plants in the region and between introduced species are unknown. During a two- week field intensive survey January 1-16th 2024 (austral summer) we recorded observations of floral visitors and their floral hosts in Puerto Williams and Yendegaia in the southernmost tip of Chile. and mapped these interactions in a preliminary visitation network. We found that the invasive B. terrestris was both present and abundant in Yendegaia where it was previously unrecorded. We found that both non-native and native floral visitors were visiting non-native plant species. Interestingly, B. terrestris was only observed visiting non-native plant species. Finally, we recorded observations of two species that are either extremely rare or previously unreported in the area in just two weeks of observation. This study overall highlights the importance of further investigations documenting the region’s biodiversity, native and non-native species interactions, and local pollinators.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
102,When Bats Take Wing: Environmental Influences of Cave myotis and Tri- colored Bat Activity Patterns,"Abstract: Bats are keystone species that serve many ecological roles including plant pollination, insect predation, and seed dispersal. However, wind energy development and white-nose syndrome (WNS) threaten bat populations. To understand how environmental conditions influence activity patterns of cave myotis (Myotis velifer; MYVE) and tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus; PESU), we conducted a three-year acoustic monitoring study (July 2020 – July 2023) using paired acoustic detectors across 49 sites in Texas. We analyzed bat activity during six, four-day periods across fall months (September-November), incorporating temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and utilized land cover variables at multiple scales (10, 25, 50 km). Linear regression analyses will examine correlations between bat activity (counts) and landcover and weather variables, including maximum and minimum temperatures. Preliminary analyses indicate that peak activity coincides with the warmest day within each sampling period for each species. Additionally, we will report the influence of landcover and weather on occupancy at sites across the state. This research will provide critical insights for management strategies that can help conserve bat species impacted by both WNS and wind energy developments throughout Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
103,American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) Spatial Ecology and the Extent of Nest Depredation by Wild Pigs (Sus scrofa) in Coastal Texas,"Abstract: This study focused on the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) in the upper coast of Texas, addressing gaps in current knowledge regarding their spatial ecology and effects of nest site selection on nest success. By employing GPS telemetry, the research aimed to elucidate breeding alligators' spatial patterns, including their fine scale measurements of daily movement. The study also examined how habitat features influence nest success and vulnerability to predation by wild pigs. A linear mixed model identified sex as a significant predictor of daily cumulative distance traveled, with males moving farther than females. Additionally, temperature and rainfall positively influenced cumulative movement while SVL, wind speed, and UV index did not have significant effects. This study utilized generalized linear models to assess factors influencing alligator nest success. Overall, the most significant predictors of nest success were distance to headquarters and distances to trees with a greater distance from both having negative effects on nest success. From 2022 to 2023, cameras were placed at 28 alligator nests, revealing wild pigs at 19 nests, with 17 of these experiencing depredations. Evidence of nest depredation and hatchling liberation both occurring was recorded at 7 sites. The use of generalized linear model analysis revealed distance to road and distance to headquarters to be significant, suggesting that greater distance from roads decreases predation risk, while nests further from headquarters face higher predation risk.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
104,Texas Tortoise’s Movement Patterns Across Chapparal WMA,"Abstract: Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) is found across portions of South Texas and Mexico, with a part of the population being found on the Chapparal Wildlife Management Area (WMA). This is an important portion of the population because it has been systematically studied for over a decade, providing species indicators and trends. This study examines how habitat is utilized and how the Texas tortoise movement trends fluctuates from month to month. Over a 14-year period employees of the Chaparral WMA performed opportunistic captures of Texas tortoise, and recorded weight and length measurements, capture location information, and marked the shell with a unique identification code. This data was then analyzed in excel functions. It was found sex ratios were fairly even across the property, and tortoises were most active between April and October. During these months tortoises experienced increased length and mass growth, due to forage availability. Habitat preference correlated with moderately rocky soils, and greater spacing between vegetation types, specifically less dense brush. Site fidelity was observed in a majority of recaptures, with females having a higher tendency to remain in a small area. The northwest portion of the Chaparral WMA was more heavily utilized than other portions due to meeting more of the observed habitat preference markers. While the data collected in this study is beneficial, more research is needed to truly understand how Texas tortoise utilizes its habitat. In future studies it would be beneficial to collect temperature, precipitation, and any foraging behavior observed.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
105,Evaluating Livestock Tank Forage and Cover Availability for Overwintering Grassland Birds in the Trans-Pecos.,"Abstract: Overwintering bird species in the Chihuahuan Desert grasslands have been undergoing population declines due to various forms of habitat degradation. Livestock tanks in the region could increase the odds of survival for birds by providing a source of food and water in an otherwise resource- limited region. Even when dry, tanks contain plant life that is unique from the typical grassland plant species surrounding them, offering a diverse location that acts as an attractant to overwintering birds. This study will identify the plants found in livestock tanks and outline their importance in terms of foraging value and cover to overwintering birds through Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. Methods include half-meter-squared quadrat sampling of vegetation seed production, line-intercept methods to outline brush coverage, and a seed bank inventory from each tank. Collecting forage value inside and outside the tanks as well as cover percentages may assist in making management decisions for both wintering birds and livestock.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
106,Midcontinent Cackling Goose (Branta hutchinsii) Migratory Connectivity,"Abstract: Migratory species make impressive movements between breeding and nonbreeding areas annually, but the capability to track species throughout the annual cycle at fine spatiotemporal scales is the result of recent technological innovations. Advances in animal tracking allow for more accurate tracking of migratory species, more frequent datapoint collection, and over longer periods of time. This can reveal aspects of the annual cycle in greater detail than previously possible. Cackling Geese (Branta hutchinsii) migrate thousands of miles annually between breeding, molting, and wintering sites. In their seasonal movements between wintering and breeding localities, numerous stopover sites are used to rest and refuel. The importance of stopover sites to migratory birds like Cackling Geese cannot be overstated, yet there is a significant lack of knowledge to inform management on where the key stopover areas are for most species, making conservation efforts less impactful. In December-February of 2022-2024, we deployed 142 GPS-GSM transmitters on female Cackling Geese wintering in the southern Great Plains; ultimately, we plan to deploy devices on ~350 geese. We aim to quantify fine-scale movement patterns and identify areas of conservation importance throughout the annual cycle. We plan to apply network analysis and graph theory to create a network model for midcontinent Cackling Geese. We expect that results from this project will provide important information to help guide managers on where to invest in conservation efforts.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
107,The Role of Soil Type and Grazing Systems in Shaping Desert Grassland Ecosystems,"Abstract: Desert grasslands are critical ecosystems that support diverse wildlife species and provide valuable resources for livestock production. However, the Trans- Pecos is subjected to habitat degradation if managed incorrectly because of the variable precipitation in desert grasslands. The choice of grazing system has long been debated as to which has the most benefits in meeting a landowner’s goal and sustaining healthy rangelands. The two most common grazing systems, rotational and continuous, can modify and sustain rangeland health. Therefore, this project aims to identify and compare grass species cover, annual standing crop production, species composition, forage nutrition, and soil moisture between a long-term rotational, continuous, and deferred grazing system in a desert grassland of the Trans-Pecos. Grasses were collected at the end of the 2023 and 2024 growing season. Random stratified sampling was used to place 690 0.5 m2 plots in all grazing regimes confined to two soil types (Marfa-clay-loam and Musquiz-clay-loam). Volumetric soil moisture was taken along with all other floristic data at each plot. Linear regression analysis showed that a continuous system will increase soil moisture between all systems overall and has the greatest increase on Musquiz-clay-loam with little to no effect on Marfa-clay-loam. A rotational system with higher overall unique species decreases soil moisture on both soil types compared to the deferred and continuous. With further analysis, this study will reinforce the importance of considering soil types when developing grazing systems and allow for grazing to be used as a management tool to conserve and restore grasslands.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
108,Scale-dependent Patterns of Woody Plant Encroachment and Grassland Fragmentation on the Welder Wildlife Refuge,"Abstract: Woody plant encroachment is a threat to grasslands globally. The Welder Wildlife Refuge in the south Texas Gulf Coast Prairie has transitioned from a tall grass prairie to a brush-grass complex due to woody plant encroachment. The use of georeferenced spatial data (e.g., satellite data) to describe the ecological characteristics of such changing landscapes can help identify scale-dependent patterns of woody plant encroachment and grassland fragmentation. Our objective is to identify the scale- dependent ecological patterns that characterize woody plant encroachment and grassland fragmentation across the Welder Wildlife Refuge. We will use satellite imagery to estimate changes in woody plant and herbaceous cover from 2000 to 2024 and analyze landscape patterns that emerge at different spatiotemporal scales using landscape metrics and a lacunarity analysis. To do so, we downloaded USDA Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 surface reflectance data from Earth Explorer collected in August 2000 and August 2024. Using the surface reflectance data, we calculated five indices which highlight landscape features. To reduce redundancy in the data, we performed a principal component analysis. We then used the principal components which explained more than 99% of the variance for land cover classification. Lastly, we calculated the percentage of landscape, area, largest patch index, a connectance index, and lacunarity using the classified data. We hypothesize that woody plant cover has dominated the landscape, and that herbaceous cover will have significantly decreased and has become more fragmented. We hope our study can improve understanding of the process of woody plant encroachment.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
109,Combing Local Ecological Knowledge and Standardized Driving Surveys to Estimate Abundance and Density of Recently Translocated Populations of Wild Turkey in East Texas,"Abstract: Roost surveys for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) are an established method for estimating population parameters locally. Meanwhile, road surveys are recommended for calculating density and abundance on a regional scale. However, road surveys may not be suitable for estimating turkey numbers in the Post Oak and Piney Woods ecoregions of eastern Texas due to the presence of dense understory vegetation which may limit detection of turkeys. In this study, we implemented an approach that incorporates standardized driving surveys and roost surveys informed by the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of property managers and compared their relative success in detecting wild turkey. We conducted 7 targeted roost surveys based on local property managers’ prior knowledge regarding turkey roosting activity. We also conducted 4 driving surveys along predetermined routes and stopped at 1 km intervals to listen for and observe turkeys. Driving surveys occurred in the morning and late afternoon to look for turkeys leaving and returning to roosts. The roost surveys informed by LEK have yielded more successful wild turkey detections (5 roost site detections and 2 flock sightings) than the driving surveys (0 roost site detections and 0 flock sightings). These findings indicate that while standardized methods are a crucial component of study design, combining these with LEK will provide a more robust assessment of population parameters in wild turkey.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
110,Can Eyeworm and Cecal Worm Burden Drive Quail Population Dynamics?,"Abstract: Over the last decade, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations across Texas have experienced perceived declines despite good climatic conditions. The abnormal response of quail populations to favorable environmental drivers, such as precipitation, has led to speculation that other factors may be driving quail population dynamics. Rising concerns surrounding quail species’ stability in Texas have fueled research efforts focused on identifying the cause of declines, and two parasitic helminths— eyeworms (Oxyspirura petrowi) and cecal worms (Aulonocephalus pennula)—have been implicated. However, no data exist linking helminth presence to disease or compromised condition in quail. We leverage ten years of helminth data from Oklahoma, northern Texas, and southern Texas to analyze trends between quail body mass and eyeworm and cecal worm burden. Body mass is an indicator of individual condition and can be used as a proxy for health status. These results will represent a foundation on which to build our understanding of the impact of helminths on quail and their role in driving population dynamics.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
111,Applying Machine Learning to Interpolate Movement Trajectories of Desert Bighorn Sheep,"Abstract: Global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices have advanced wildlife studies related to movement, migration, and resource selection. However, two forms of bias plague most analyses, which include missed GPS fixes and inaccuracy of location estimates. These forms of bias result from technological failures, the arrangement of satellites, behavior of the animal, and environmental factors such as canopy cover and topography. We initiated a translocation study of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) in Sonora, Mexico as a part of a long-term restoration study to sustain populations and harvest. Preliminary analysis of GPS data revealed missing fixes, especially at certain times of the year and day (i.e., warmer months during the middle of the day); video from GPS collars shows that sheep use caves as temperatures increase. The cave, topography, and behavior of the sheep led to reduced GPS fixes, so we explored various analytical methods to account for or interpolate missing locations. We modeled, fit, and simulated GPS fixes using treed Gaussian processes, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, Bayesian additive regression trees, and random forest models. We will report results of the statistical models and how these analytical methods can be used to reduce bias in resource selection and movement studies as the result of missed fixes and inaccurate locations. However, static testing of collars before deployment, or simulation with empirical data, will be necessary to improve accuracy of model results.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
112,Evaluating the Precision of Images for Wildlife Morphometry: A Comparison with Traditional Methods for Measuring Ampibians,"Abstract: The measurement of wildlife species’ morphology can be time-consuming. Traditional methods of morphometric measurement, such as by hand with calipers, can divert time away from other research activities. Advancements in camera technology and digital analysis tools like ImageJ, a free digital analysis software, provide potential alternatives. While ImageJ has been used for wildlife morphometrics, its accuracy compared to calipers has been underexplored, particularly for larval amphibians. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of ImageJ in comparison to digital calipers via measurements of snout-vent length (SVL), total body length (TBL), and head width (HW) of larval and metamorphosed spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and southern leopard frogs (Lithobates sphenocephalus). Due to previous research demonstrating a correlation between surface area and tadpole mass, we used TBL and HW to calculate elliptical surface area. We found that morphometrics assessed using ImageJ were not significantly different from data collected via calipers (t = 1.21, P > 0.05), and that mass and elliptical surface area found were highly correlated (r = 0.936, P < 0.001). High correlation between mass and elliptical surface area suggests that a proportionality constant could be used to predict mass from elliptical surface area of larval amphibians. Traditional methods require removal of larvae from water and blotting them dry, which may elevate stress and mortality rates. However, our results demonstrate that ImageJ offers a non-invasive alternative to traditional methods of determining mass. Therefore, we recommend the use of ImageJ as an alternative to the use of traditional methods of wildlife measurements.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
113,Establishment of Blood Reference Intervals for Nilgai from South Texas,"Abstract: Nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) are an invasive antelope species brought into the United States to private ranchlands in southern Texas around the 1920s from India as an exotic game species. Since their introduction, the nilgai range and population size has increased, and they are now found throughout southern Texas, with continued northward expansion. Nilgai are still an important source of income for landholders, as they are popular for recreational harvest and their products are sold commercially for culinary use. However, nilgai have been implicated as the main driver of cattle fever tick and babesiosis dynamics in southern Texas, which has health and economic implications for cattle operations. Understanding nilgai health is important for managing agricultural bovid species in the landscape. This study aims to quantify blood reference intervals for nilgai in southern Texas to establish baseline health metrics and allow for health surveillance. Whole blood and serum samples were taken from 146 female nilgai, identified as at least one year of age, following harvest for complete blood counts and serum chemistry analysis. We compare these intervals to other ungulates in the family Bovidae, including domestic cattle (Bos taurus) and the common eland (Taurotragus oryx).",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
114,Patterns of Population Structure and Gene Flow in a Fragmented Environment: How Road Infrastructure Impacts Bobcat and Ocelot Dispersal,"Abstract: Roads, as critical infrastructures of modern society, pose significant barriers to wildlife movement, impeding gene flow and impacting local genetic population structure. Genetic consequences of urbanization include reduced effective population size, decreased adaptive potential, and genetic stochasticity. Habitat fragmentation, coupled with varying levels of stochasticity, threatens the long-term genetic viability of local species populations. We will investigate how urbanization, specifically the presence of roads, affects the population genetics of bobcats (Lynx rufus) and endangered ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) living in a heavily fragmented environment. We will examine neutral genetic diversity and connectivity as well as kinship diversity among bobcats and ocelots in southern Texas using a combinatorial genetic approach including microsatellite, mitochondrial, and genomic markers. We predict that roads will diminish bobcat and ocelot dispersal patterns and thus generate contemporary restrictions of gene flow, limiting heterogeneity and genomic diversity within and between distinct populations. Attenuated population structure and connectivity will persist, and an elevated magnitude of inbreeding will be observed in fragmented populations, ultimately resulting in notable genetic erosion and further population decline. The expected minimal movement through the fragmented landscape and the associated absence of gene flow imply that roads hinder felid spatial patterns. Thus, continued road development will exacerbate this problem further and threaten the long- term persistence and recovery of the existing gene pool for both felid species. Our approach will provide insight for regulating the interconnectivity between local biodiversity and road infrastructure, and effective conservation management strategies will be applied to small, fragmented populations facing similar anthropogenic pressures.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
115,Ocelot Guzzler Utilization on Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge,"Abstract: Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge provides vital habitat for the endangered ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), with artificial water sources (guzzlers) serving as important resources for the species. Recent camera surveys have identified 21 individual ocelots within the refuge, with notable activity observed at guzzlers. This study aims to investigate guzzler utilization patterns to understand their role in ocelot habitat use and inform conservation strategies. Fourteen guzzlers were monitored using two cameras per station, totaling 28 cameras. Cameras were checked monthly over a 10-month period, and ocelot activity was recorded. Ocelots were not observed at every guzzler, indicating potential habitat preferences or territorial behaviors. We will analyze visitation frequency, duration, and seasonal variations, correlating these data with environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation. We anticipate that ocelot visitation to guzzlers increases during drier months, reflecting reliance on artificial water sources when natural water is scarce. Understanding these patterns will aid in optimizing the placement and maintenance of guzzlers, contributing to improved management practices aimed at supporting the recovery of this endangered population.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
116,Role of Invasive Plants in Shifting Vegetative Communities Across a South Texas Rangeland,"Abstract: Grassland ecosystems are threatened by land use conversion and fragmentation. Grasslands can be fragmented by encroachment of native woody species and the spread of nonnative and invasive grasses. These processes can lead to shifting vegetation structure that may impact vegetative communities and the wildlife species that occupy them. We evaluated the impacts of woody encroachment and invasive grasses on the coverage of vegetative communities at the Welder Wildlife Refuge in San Patricio County, Texas, USA. We measured vegetative structure and species composition across 145, 10 m diameter, plots spaced 500 m apart in 2024. We determined coverage of vegetative communities using supervised classification of aerial imagery and validated these classifications using field data. We compared these generated classifications of vegetation communities across the property to maps of historical vegetation communities. A combination of previous research results and remotely sensed datasets indicated that woody encroachment (e.g., species such as Honey Mesquite (Neltuma glandulosa) and Huisache (Vachellia farnesiana)), had increased during the past 4 decades. Invasive grasses like Old World bluestems (Dichanthium spp. and Bothriochloa spp.) became established on the property during the 1980’s and are now dominant species in areas containing clay soils. This work will be used to evaluate the drivers behind vegetative invasion across rangelands and provide managers information on where to focus efforts to control invasive vegetation.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
117,Analyzing the Effects of Pine Plantation Developmental Stage on Wildlife Diversity Using a Multi-taxa Approach,"Abstract: Timber plantations in the Southeastern U.S. are predominantly composed of loblolly pine, forming monocultures of this species in forests across the region. As pine plantations are continually being replanted, grown, and harvested, different developmental stages can be found across the landscape. Our goal was to utilize a multi-taxa approach to better understand the effects of developmental stage on wildlife diversity by sampling insect floral visitors, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals within loblolly pine plantations to determine diversity in wildlife assemblages among early establishment (EE) and mid-rotation (MR) stands. Twelve sites, with each containing one EE (0-4 years old) and one MR (18-29 years old) pine stand, were sampled, i.e., a paired-plot sampling design. The following techniques were utilized for sampling wildlife: automated recording units, blue vane traps, camera traps, coverboards, and opportunistic encounter surveys. We hypothesized EE pine stands to have significantly higher species richness levels for insect floral visitors and reptiles, while MR pine stands would have significantly higher species richness levels for amphibians with both stand types having similar avian and mammalian richness levels. We additionally expected significant differences in the species compositions between all taxa, apart from the mammals. Results from our study showed that no taxa groups had significantly different species richness levels between either developmental stage. However, species compositions between both developmental stages were more variable for some taxa. In conclusion, while diversity levels between stand types were non-significant, managers should still provide multiple stages of pine stand development to maximize wildlife diversity.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
118,Feathers in the Frame: Exploring the Opportunities and Limitations of Camera Traps in Avian Research,"Abstract: Camera traps are non-invasive tools used to monitor wildlife across a wide range of ecological applications. Researchers utilize camera traps to assess wildlife distributions, diversity, population trends, and behavior. Camera traps are typically used for mammalian research, but avians are occasionally documented through bycatch. Larger birds were expected to be more likely to trigger camera traps and stay in the frame long enough to identify. Additionally, it was expected that species who forage near the ground, such as upland game birds, were to be captured more often compared to species that forage within the canopy. The documentation of avian activity and diversity levels may facilitate ways to prioritize crucial habitats for breeding, feeding, and migration stop-overs. For this study, 24 camera traps were deployed over six months across 12 sites throughout East Texas, each yielding one early establishment (0-4 years of age) and one mid-rotational (18-29 years of age) stand of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation, i.e., a paired plot sampling design. To determine the efficacy of utilizing camera traps in documenting avians, the occurrence and diversity of these avians were evaluated, along with the likelihood of capture based on life history traits (i.e., ground-nesting birds). Out of over 20,000 wildlife captures, >5% of captures were of avians. In total, 12 species were documented. Larger species and species with ground-associated life history traits were most captured on camera . The most documented species was the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and small passerines were the least documented.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
119,Evaluating Native Bee Communities in Habitat Restored for Upland Game Birds in East Texas,"Abstract: Bees are responsible for the reproduction of many wild flowering plants and about 85% of crops. Some bee populations have experienced major declines in recent years. Habitat management can be an effective tool to mitigate the stressors impacting bee populations. Management tools such as return of natural disturbance regimes (e.g., prescribed fire), planting native plants, and mowing can help restore habitat to historical conditions. My research aimed to investigate how upland game birds may act as umbrella species in management for native bees. I compared Bombus spp. assemblages in sites that had been restored as habitat for upland game birds and those that had remained unrestored from June to August 2024 in five counties in East Texas using blue vane traps. I also measured habitat characteristics and floral abundance and diversity at each site. I conducted a GLM using a negative binomial distribution to examine Bombus spp. abundance across restored and unrestored sites. The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in bee abundance, with restored sites supporting a greater abundance of bees compared to unrestored sites. Habitat in restored sites was typically characterized by greater floral abundance and diversity, lower vegetation density, lower canopy cover, and a greater abundance of grasses. These results can guide landowners in effectively managing habitat for bees within the scope of established management plans for other species such as upland game birds.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
120,Winter is Coming: Understanding Winter Activity Patterns and Occupancy Status of Tricolored Bats Throughout Texas,"Abstract: Tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus; PESU) were once one of the most common and widely distributed bat species across the United States. However, populations have experienced great declines since the introduction of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in 2006 – ultimately leading to its proposed Endangered status. In 2024, WNS was detected on PESU in Texas, further highlighting the species' vulnerability. Bat activity was once widely believed and accepted as uncommon during the winter, but recent research has demonstrated that many bat species remain active. However, little is known about PESU winter behavior outside of hibernacula. To better understand acoustic activity of PESU across temperature and latitudinal gradients during the winter, we recorded nightly echolocation calls using the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) protocol. We used 49 NABat grid cells, each 10 km2 with two detectors, across the state of Texas from December through March 2020–2023. We selected two 4-day periods per winter month (i.e., 8 periods/year, 24 total) for multi- season occupancy analysis. We assessed the influence of landcover at 10-, 25-, and 50-km radii around each recorder. Additionally, we examined the influence of daily minimum and maximum temperatures to explore winter temperature thresholds. Preliminary results indicate that PESU remain active throughout the winter despite daily low temperatures of -5.6°C, though this may be infrequent. Knowledge of winter ecology is essential to develop effective conservation action plans for imperiled bat species whose populations are at-risk from WNS.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
121,Sustainable Grazing Effects on Spider Communities in North-central Texas Rangelands,"Abstract: Arthropods contribute ecosystems services to rangelands, such as pollination, nutrient cycling, pest regulation, and as a food source for other wildlife species. Spiders (Arachnida: Araneae) play a crucial role in top-down regulation of herbivorous insect prey that otherwise reduce availability of forage for wildlife and livestock; however, spider assemblages could be negatively affected by unsustainable rangeland practices, such as intensive grazing by domesticated livestock. The purpose of our study was to determine the influence of grazing on spider communities in north- central Texas. Specifically, we sought to: 1) quantify changes in vegetation communities in rangelands under different grazing pressures; 2) determine the relationship between grazing pressure, spiders, and their arthropod prey; and 3) identify the best range management practice to promote occupancy and biodiversity of spider communities. Field sites include ungrazed, previously grazed (0.8-1.0 AUM/ha), and overgrazed (> 1.0 AUM/ha) pastures in Erath Co., Texas. We sampled vegetation and arthropods every two weeks from late April to late October 2024. We measured vegetation cover, density, and height along 30-m line-intercept transects. We sampled arthropods with one pitfall trap every 3 m and vacuum sampling every 5 m along the transects. Preliminary results suggest previously grazed areas may reduce species diversity and prey composition, with similar reductions in predatory arthropods. We hope to guide sustainable management practices and enhance biodiversity for spiders and other arthropods within rangelands and other working lands in the southern Great Plains.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
122,Exploring Mycorrhizal Dynamics: A Comparative Analysis of Rotational VS. Continuous Grazing Systems,"Abstract: Desert ecosystems are vital in supporting ranching by providing essential ecosystem services despite their fragility. In regions where ranching, grazing, and wildlife management are viable, understanding how land management practices affect the ecosystem is essential. Desert grasslands are vulnerable to degradation, particularly those dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis). Management practices can significantly influence plant communities and overall ecosystem health. Different grazing systems were developed to improve ecosystem health and productivity, though their effectiveness is debatable. Blue grama helps maintain productivity in ranching operations as its health closely relates to underground processes, such as the symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). AMF enhances water and nutrient uptake and supports plant resilience. This study examines how different grazing systems – continuous and rotational – affect AMF communities in blue grama across two distinct soil types – Marfa and Musquiz clay loams. Mycorrhizal colonization was evaluated using the magnified gridline intersection method after staining roots to assess these differences. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA, were conducted to evaluate mycorrhizal colonization across plots with continuous and rotational grazing on Marfa and Musquiz clay loams. Rotational grazing resulted in higher mycorrhizal colonization than continuous grazing, suggesting that rotational grazing creates more favorable conditions for mycorrhizal fungi. For landowners and ranchers in the Chihuahuan Desert, this study emphasizes the importance of adopting sustainable land management practices that support the health of mycorrhizal communities. By prioritizing rotational grazing, ranchers can reduce soil compaction, maintain vegetation cover, and support the symbiotic relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
123,Assessing Presence of Microplastics in Mississippi Kites,"Abstract: Plastic pollution poses a substantive risk for environmental, animal, and human health. Microplastics (<5mm) are especially prevalent in aquatic systems. Microplastics may more easily enter the food web and transfer from prey to predators associated with these systems. We assessed microplastic burdens in Mississippi kite (Ictinia missippiensis) specimens (n = 18; 11 adult, 7 nestling) provided by the South Plains Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Lubbock, TX. Locally, the primary prey of Mississippi kites are dragonflies (Odonata) and cicadas (Hemiptera), each of which has a life history that includes occupancy of water bodies and adjacent moist soils, respectively. Mississippi kites specimens were stored at -20° C until thawed for analyses. To minimize risk of contamination by plastic microfibers during tissue harvest, researchers wore cotton clothing, lab coats, and nitrile gloves, and all work took place on a covered table or under a fume hood. We collected breast and liver tissue from each bird, wrapped each tissue sample in aluminum foil, labeled the sample, and froze it until further processing. Prior to tissue digestion, we weighed the wet mass of each sample to the nearest gram. Bird tissues were digested in 10% potassium hydroxide solution for 24 hours and then placed in an oven at 50° Celsius. Following digestions, we filtered samples to capture plastics. Each filter was dried, then observed under a microscope with a UV light and microplastics were counted, measured, and features (color, shape) were recorded. Analyses are ongoing and final results will be presented.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
124,Utilizing Blood Analysis to Evaluate Health of Collared Peccary,"Abstract: Collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) once ranged over much of Texas, but today, they are primarily found in southern and western Texas with smaller populations in the Hill Country and Rolling Plains ecoregions of Texas. Until recently, a paucity of data has been available on collared peccary with most research dating back nearly 30 years. To learn more about peccary behavior, health, and population status, several large studies were initiated in southern Texas, so as part of these studies, we will assess peccary health using body measurements and blood panel evaluation. We evaluated total white blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) counts, total plasma protein, and relative neutrophil count due to their associations with physiological stress and nutritional status. To date, we have captured >60 peccary and analyzed blood panels for five peccary; additional results are forthcoming. We found that WBC counts (9.06-14.1 K/µL), plasma proteins (8.5-9.0 g/dL), and fibrinogen (200-500 mg/dL) were within previously reported ranges for captive collared peccary in moderate to good nutritional condition whereas RBC counts (4.5-5.92 M/µL) appeared lower than those of even nutrient-restricted individuals. Considering these values and assessment of body condition (e.g., body mass, morphometrics, age, etc.), most peccary appeared healthy. These assessments will help elucidate the interdependent relationships among peccary health and survival, reproduction, population dynamics, resource selection, and habitat quality.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
125,Exploring Beetle Community Dynamics Following Long-Term Grassland Restoration Efforts in a New England Grassland,"Abstract: Arthropods are undergoing unprecedented declines in biodiversity across the globe, but the scope of these declines vary in space and time, justifying a need for examining management and conservation efforts at local scales. Some factors that contribute to arthropod declines include habitat loss and degradation and the introduction of invasive plants. Our study examines the relationship between beetle (Coleoptera) diversity and restoration efforts in a restored grassland in Suffolk Co, New York. Our study site is Fishers Island, an island 3 km off the coast of southeastern Connecticut, where 49 ha of property is managed to improve grassland diversity and reduce dominance of invasive plants since 2010. We surveyed vegetation and arthropods in summer 2024 in 15 50-m transects with 1-m2 quadrats placed at 5-m intervals. We estimated plant species richness and horizontal canopy cover within each quadrat; we also sampled beetles using pitfall traps and an insect vacuum within the same quadrat. We will identify beetles to family and assign each to a functional group. We predict that beetle family richness will positively correlate with native plant canopy cover. We also will present associations between beetles and plant species richness, based on taxonomic and functional groups. In future analyses we will explore additional arthropod taxa and their responses to long-term restoration and compare current biodiversity to past studies. We hope to provide insight on how to promote ecological resilience for arthropods undergoing declines in landscapes dominated by invasive plants and to encourage conservation efforts of arthropods at local scales.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
126,Identifying Plant-pollinator Networks Associated with Native Grasses in North- Texas,"Abstract: Long-term studies report declines in pollinator abundance and sustainable land use at global scales, highlighting the need to enhance conservation efforts at local scales. Concurrently, North American grassland ecosystems have declined, with concomitant effects on pollinator communities. Despite being primarily wind-pollinated, grasses play a crucial role to pollinators by providing nesting structure and supplemental pollen when other floral resources are limited, particularly during drought. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associate with plant roots, uptaking nutrients and priming plant health, thereby influencing components of plant reproduction. We seek to assess the efficacy of AMF on pollinator communities associated with Texas grasslands by addressing the following objectives: (1) quantify insect pollinator networks associated with a suite of native grasses with AMF infection during the flowering period in North- Central Texas, and (2) assess AMF infection on grass pollen productivity and nutritive value at early and late flowering stages. We used a randomized split plot design under 4 treatment combinations: mycorrhizal inoculum (treated with either mycorrhizae or fungicide), nutrient load (fertilizer added or absent), and 5 species of native warm- season perennial grasses. We collected data on soil, pollen, flower visitors, and floral characteristics. We monitored activity every two weeks during the flowering period. Preliminary data suggest the majority of insect visitors consisting of true flies (Diptera) and greatest visitation observed on sideoats gramma (Bouteloua curtipendula) compared to other grasses (p<0.001). We seek to provide a baseline for understanding aboveground-belowground trophic interactions and guide pollinator conservation initiatives in Texas grassland ecosystems.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
127,Is There a Relationship Between Temperature and Songbird Egg Mass?,"Abstract: Climate change is causing global temperature increases and may consequently have negative effects on songbird reproduction. Studies have shown that birds with greater mass on hatch day have a higher survival rate. However, higher temperatures can negatively affect egg mass, resulting in smaller clutch mass. We monitored house sparrow (Passer domesticus) breeding colonies in Stephenville, TX, and Fargo, ND from March through August 2022, 2023, and 2024. Our objective was to investigate the potential relationship between temperature and variation in egg mass. We predicted that egg mass would be smaller in Texas than in North Dakota, and that as temperatures within a site increase, clutch mass would decrease. We weighed each clutch after confirming clutch completion (1 day after the last egg is hatched). We calculated egg mass (g) by dividing the mass of the total clutch (g) by the total number of eggs in the clutch. We calculated mean daily temperature during the incubation period for each nest at each site using temperature data from the nearest weather station to each site. We will examine the relationship between egg mass and mean daily temperature during the laying period for each nest. By evaluating the patterns of variation in egg mass correlated with temperature we can conclude that increasing temperature may contribute to reduced reproductive success in songbirds with implications for how birds may respond to climate change.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
128,Comparing Methodologies for Assessing Herpetofauna Diversity in Southern Pine Stands,"Abstract: Herpetofauna are vitally important to every ecosystem they inhabit. Documenting herpetofaunal diversity can be used to assess ecosystem health and functionality, which can be a complicated task. The ability to detect reptiles and amphibians is influenced by environmental and behavioral variables, which often result in inaccurate estimates of diversity when only a single method is utilized. For this project, herpetofaunal richness was documented using a paired-plot sampling design across 12 sites. Each site contained two plots, one early establishment (0-4 years old) and one mid-rotation (18-29 years old) stand of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). To evaluate the efficacy of sampling methodologies in determining the diversity of herpetofauna, we employed coverboards (used to document fossorial and cryptic herpetofauna), automated recording units (ARUs, used to record the calls of anurans), and opportunistic encounters (OEs, based on direct observations to record any chance- encountered herpetofauna). Coverboards resulted in the fewest species detections, while ARUs and OEs provided greater species observations. However, each methodology used observed unique species. Our study highlights the value of employing several methodologies when evaluating the species richness of herpetofaunal communities.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
129,Green-green Dilemma: Prioritizing Mitigation Efforts for Bats and Wind Energy,"Abstract: As renewable energy expands, bats, especially red (Lasiurus borealis/blossevilli, hereafter ‘red bats’) and hoary (Lasiurus cinereus; LACI) bats, are increasingly threatened by collisions with wind turbine blades. This issue poses a serious risk of population declines or even extinction for these species. This conservation challenge is exacerbated by a lack of baseline data on bat activity and occupancy across the nation. To address the risks posed by wind energy development, it is essential to integrate mitigation strategies with data on bat occupancy and activity. This study investigates seasonal bat activity and occupancy in Texas from Fall 2020 to Summer 2023, using two acoustic detectors at each of 49 sites to collect echolocation calls. We aimed to identify weather variables that may influence activity in the fall, as this season aligns with the greatest wind energy-related fatalities. Results suggest significant season-specific weather variables that influenced bat activity. Humidity positively influenced LACI activity during the fall. For red bats, both temperature and humidity influenced activity, with a positive influence from temperature and a negative influence from humidity. In the future, we will integrate wind turbine locations in Texas and their MW capacity with bat occupancy data to pinpoint ""hotspots"" where bats may be most vulnerable. Understanding bat occupancy and activity and the factors that may influence both can facilitate informed and effective wildlife management decisions. This knowledge not only benefits bat conservation efforts but may also assist landowners in creating a cost-effective approach to regulating wind turbine operations.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
130,Influencing the Next Generation of Land Stewards Through High School Engagement and Beyond,"Abstract: The Land Stewardship Ambassador program was created through a partnership with East Foundation and The Witte Museum. The goal of the program is to increase awareness of land stewardship principles, promote civil engagement in today’s youth, and inspire students to obtain careers that support land stewardship. High school students were selected through a rigorous evaluation process and are admitted into a 10-week reading and writing intensive course. Three cohorts of students hailing from San Antonio (Bexar County), Brownsville (Cameron County), and Laredo (Webb County) in Texas are concurrently enrolled, totaling forty-five students. This program, which emphasizes writing and reading proficiency, necessitates students to synthesize their understanding of weekly readings focused on exemplars of land stewardship. Moreover, students participate in place-based learning at The Witte Museum, Lake Casa Blanca State Park and the San Antonio Viejo Ranch, where they acquaint themselves with the historical significance of these sites and partake in collaborative endeavors designed to cultivate a heightened awareness of land stewardship across various domains. Based on the data from the aforementioned cohorts, 174 out of 220 alumni answered an alumni post-survey. Of the alumni polled, 67.7% reported adopting a more land- stewardship-focused awareness (ISA), 44.5% reported engaging in civic and community activities (COM), and 48.6% said they pursued a degree or career in land stewardship (CA). The degree tracks were a great discovery based on the numbers, but the program's actual success in implementing land stewardship awareness was made clear by the alumni exit surveys, exit essays, and alumni surveys.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
131,Texas Wildlife and the Border Barrier System: How Species are Moving Through a Large-scale Anthropogenic Barrier,"Abstract: Landscape-scale barriers can influence wildlife population demographics and individual behaviors. Anthropogenic barriers, like fencing and highways, have been shown to impede movement and ultimately contribute to decreased rates of dispersal, gene flow, and overall connectivity between metapopulations. This loss of connectivity can create isolated populations, exacerbating the risk of inbreeding and local extirpation. Our study evaluates the potential impacts of the nine-meter-tall transboundary border barrier system between Texas and Mexico, which by definition acts as a barrier. It may be a semi-permeable barrier however, as animals are able to use openings in the fence to cross. To investigate how the barrier may be influencing movement and connectivity, we will analyze six months of camera data from 22 printer- paper-sized wildlife crossing structures and 10 inadvertent openings in the barrier structure. We will analyze the amount of animal crossings as a function of structure type, species, distance to stream corridors, and time of day using a linear regression model. To date, we have recorded the crossing structures being used by coyote (Canis latrans) and the inadvertent openings in the barrier being used by mountain lion (Puma concolor), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), feral hog (Sus scrofa), javelina (Tayassu tajacu), coyote, bobcat (Lynx rufus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Understanding the interactions of wildlife with the border barrier system and its crossing opportunities will help to inform effective mitigation strategies, ensuring that barrier systems can perform their intended purpose while allowing for some wildlife movements.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
132,Assessing the Use of Drones to Monitor Pronghorn Herd Dynamics,"Abstract: Drones offer a promising future in wildlife research, monitoring, and management. We assessed the use of drones to monitor herd size and composition of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in western Oklahoma, comparing data collected from the DJI Matrice 210 V2 (hereafter Matrice) with the Zenmuse Z30 camera (30x optical zoom) and the DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2 (hereafter Phantom) with the onboard camera. We conducted 48 flights over pronghorn in July 2024 at heights of 120, 90, and 60 meters above ground level. For each flight, we performed ground composition and herd size counts to compare with drone composition (Matrice) and herd size counts (Matrice and Phantom). We used mean difference and standard error to compare ground and aerial counts for juvenile and male proportions within each group and total herd size. Further, we tested for composition differences between herds that did or didn’t flee from the drone. When comparing ground counts to Matrice counts, differences (mean difference ± SE) were negligible for juvenile proportions (0.05 ± 0.03), male proportions (0.16 ± 0.07), and herd size (-0.08 ± 0.32). However, when compared to ground counts, Phantom counts underestimated herd size (-2.13 ± 0.83). When comparing herds that fled to herds that didn’t, juvenile proportions (-0.02 ± 0.07) and male proportions (-0.18 ± 0.16) didn’t appear to influence reaction to the drone. Our results indicate that the Matrice provides information similar to ground counts while the Phantom is less accurate. Further investigation is needed to refine flight parameters while maxing data collection.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
133,Influence of Nest Insulation on Hatching Success During Extreme Heat,"Abstract: Nests are essential for a bird’s reproductive success, with substantial energy invested into their construction. Nest design varies in size, shape, placement, and material, and during extreme temperatures these characteristics may influence reproductive success by providing insulation. Our study evaluates house sparrow (Passer domesticus) hatching success in Stephenville, Texas associated with nest site characteristics and temperature. Under the hypothesis that nest boxes and nest material have insulator properties to maintain temperature, we predicted hatching success will be higher in boxes with high amounts of nest material and in boxes located in cooler sites. We monitored nests during the March–August 2024 breeding season. We measured hatching success as the proportion of hatched eggs surviving to post- hatch day 2 relative to initial clutch size. We quantified nest size using a 1–5 scale, and we recorded solar orientation, shade (scale of 1-3), and box mounting structure (e.g., stone or metals). We recorded internal nest temperature on incubation days 4–8 and ambient temperature across the study area using iButtons. Preliminary results (n = 38 nest boxes) showed mean nest temperature was lower than mean ambient temperature for most boxes, but nest site characteristics did not explain mean nest temperatures. Additionally, as temperatures increased across the season, there was a greater reduction in box temperatures relative to ambient, which supports the assumption that nests buffer high ambient temperatures. This study will increase our understanding of how nest characteristics of cavity-nesting birds influence hatching success with implications for climate change.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
134,"Body Size Diversity and Correlation Among Characiformes Fish in the Essequibo River, Guyana","Abstract: The order Characiformes includes ecologically and morphologically diverse fishes that occupy various habitats in Neotropical rivers. It contains well-known species like piranhas and tetras, which display a wide range of trophic specializations and body sizes. Given this diversity, we aimed to explore the distribution of body sizes in characiform fishes from the Essequibo River near Iwokrama Forest, Guyana. Fish surveys were conducted in May 2024 using various fishing gear to sample different habitats, including the main channel, floodplain lakes, and creeks. Characiforms were identified to the lowest taxonomic level (genus or species), counted, and the body size of five individuals was measured when available. In total, 58 species from 31 genera and 12 families were collected, with most species coming from the main channel and creeks. The families Serrasalmidae (piranhas) and Characidae (tetras) had the greatest species richness. Species in the Serrasalmidae exhibited the most variability in body shape and size, while the largest individuals collected were in the family Cynodontidae (payara or vampire fish). A few species were collected from unique habitats; for example, the hatchetfish (Gasteropelecidae) and the wolf characin Hoplias (Erythrinidae) were found in shallow creeks with leaf litter and vegetation, while the pinktail surface-dweller characin Chalceus (Chalceidae) was only collected in the marginal shallow areas of the main channel. Future research will focus on quantifying the trophic position of Characiformes using stable isotope analysis of Carbon and Nitrogen to examine body size and trophic position across families and habitats in the Essequibo River.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
135,Avian/Solar Interactions During Fall Migration Through the Central Flyway,"Abstract: As the development of photovoltaic (PV) solar power facilities expands throughout Texas, and because Texas is part of the Central Flyway migration path, there is an inherent need to understand how solar facilities affect avian functional diversity as birds migrate through Texas. To investigate relationships, we will compare community composition during fall migration between PV solar facility sites and reference sites with habitat comparable to solar sites prior to development. To collect data, we will assign transect plot locations at each site for trail cameras and acoustic recorders, and we will program acoustic recorders to record bird calls daily for 4 hours, starting after sunrise, and trail cameras to capture multiple images once they are triggered. We will collect data for 12 weeks during fall migration, August 15 – November 8. To compare avian functional diversity between solar and reference sites, we will determine the functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence of all sites using community composition data and determining how traits of species observed effect their ecosystem (i.e. functional effect traits). Because anthropogenic change and solar development have been linked to reduced species abundance, richness, and functional diversity in birds, we predict that avian functional diversity will be lower at the solar sites compared to the reference sites. Determining avian functional diversity can assist solar site managers in making informed decisions on how to manage/improve site quality for wildlife for current and future PV solar facilities.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
136,Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris) Nesting Success in North Texas,"Abstract: Painted Buntings (Passerina ciris) is a species of conservation concern, as populations have faced declines over the past several decades. We aimed to analyze the nesting success of Painted Buntings in North Texas and recorded 115 active nests during the breeding season from May through August in the years 2020-2024. We observed variables such as nest height, substrate height and species, and month found across two study grids at Lake Lewisville Environmental Learning Area (LLELA) in Lewisville, TX. Of the 115 nests, 40 (34.78%) were recorded as successful. Brown- headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) parasitized 15% of active nests, but success between parasitized and non-parasitized nests was relatively insignificant (P = 0.9706). Painted Buntings in our study preferred to nest in Cedar Elm (Ulmus crassifolia), with 47 out of 115 nests found within this substrate. The average substrate choice height was 4.64 m, and the average nest height was 1.47 m. Additionally, Painted Buntings preferred Bison Range, the grid with the most open habitat, to our more dense, woody study grid, Barn Owl Ridge. Data on Painted Buntings in the western population, specifically on nesting success, has been understudied. As Painted Buntings face threats like illegal bird trade and habitat loss, it is crucial to determine what factors are most important to Painted Buntings for their nesting success. Areas like North Texas have faced increasing development, which may harm avian populations such as Painted Buntings. Understanding these variables could provide insight into conservation efforts for Painted Buntings to prevent further population declines.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
137,Classifying Wintering Roost Sites of American Kestrels in North Texas,"Abstract: American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) populations have been steadily declining since the 1960s. Many studies within their breeding grounds have attempted to understand this decline, yet the cause remains unknown. Here, we present data and examine roost use by American Kestrels within their wintering territories in north Texas. Using radiotelemetry, we tracked kestrels to their roost sites at dusk in Denton County, Texas. Our observations suggest kestrels predominantly roosted in manmade sites (88.9%) compared to natural sites (11.1%). Among the manmade roosts, 50% roosted in the hollow arms of electric transmission poles, with the remainder in barns and within holes or gaps under the rafters of buildings. Additionally, based on a limited sample (n = 7), kestrels used the same roost site during successive nights and entered their roosts on average 34.8 min before sunset (range = 172 min before sunset – 69 min after sunset). Cavity roosts were located on average 156.4 m from the nearest foraging location (a 95% MCP point) and 664.3 m from the nearest core foraging location (a 50% MCP point). These observations, though preliminary, suggest that the availability of winter roost sites may limit winter habitat use by American Kestrels. We suggest that high quality roost sites may be a limiting factor for kestrels and that kestrels must make tradeoffs between roost site quality and territory quality when establishing a home range.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
138,The Impacts of Imidacloprid Exposure on Ring-necked Pheasant Growth and Survival,"Abstract: Ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) are important upland gamebirds experiencing population declines throughout portions of its U.S. range. In the Southern High Plains of Texas, > 95% of the landscape is in industrialized agriculture, with ubiquitous neonicotinoid insecticide use on corn, soy, wheat, and cotton seeds prior to planting. Free-ranging pheasants commonly consume waste grains and exist in relatively constant contact with these insecticides. Therefore, we are examining impacts of Imidacloprid on pen-raised pheasants, using three levels of treated feed to examine how ingestion of Imidacloprid affects pheasants during the first 22 weeks of life. We are using 64 pheasants starting at 16 weeks old, and one group of 32 starting at 7 weeks old, all with an equal sex ratio. We collected body mass and condition, red blood cell count, white blood cell differential, hematocrit, and blood serum chemistry profile data every two weeks until termination. Mass spectroscopy will be used to measure Imidacloprid concentrations in feathers, liver, and kidney tissues. To date, body mass varied among treatments, some individuals lost mass during the first week of elevated exposure, while controls gained mass through the feeding trials. Preliminary blood chemistry data indicate mean total protein as 3.5 g/dL, while individuals exposed to medium or high-level treatment had greater chances of total protein concentrations falling < 3.0, indicating liver or kidney issues. This research will provide baseline information on impacts of Imidacloprid on pheasant growth and development, which may be useful for both free-ranging and captive-reared populations.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
139,Occurrence of Cryptic-Owl Species in the Fort Davis Mountains,"Abstract: Several cryptic owl species are present in the Davis Mountains but have only been detected occasionally. Flammulated owls (Psiloscops flammeolus) are a rare migratory species that are thought to arrive in West Texas during the summer and are found primarily in dry forests with tall coniferous trees. Northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) may occur year-round and prefer dense coniferous forests. Western screech-owls (Megascops kennicottii) occur year-round in the Davis Mountains and are adaptable to a wide range of habitats. Elf owls (Micrathene whitneyi) are found only in the summer in the western part of the state. They nest in tree and cactus cavities in desert woodlands and pine-oak forests. To detect these four species, we placed automated recording units (ARUs) in suitable owl habitat within the Davis Mountains Preserve (DMP), which is owned by The Nature Conservancy. The ARUs were set to record from 18 June until 17 July 2023. We are using BirdNet and Kaleidoscope software to detect species based on their unique calls. Of the nine ARU locations analyzed so far for the month of June, we have detected flammulated owls, northern saw-whet owls, and western screech-owls at six locations each, and elf owls at two locations. Each location had at least one target species present, and three locations had three target species detected. Ongoing work will include analyzing the rest of the data and conducting field surveys at the DMP to confirm owl presence at each ARU location.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
140,A Systematic Review of Extreme Climatic Events and Their Impacts on Avifauna,"Abstract: Extreme climatic events (ECEs), defined as climatic events where conditions occurring are rare relative to the distribution of those conditions and also result in an extreme negative biological response, are increasing in frequency and severity as a result of pressures from global climate change. Research investigating extreme climatic events on biological communities can disagree or even ignore an operating definition of an ECE, resulting in possible ambiguity in determining impacts of true ECEs. To highlight these challenges, we sought to determine the current state of research on ECEs relative to avifaunal species at a global extent. More specifically, we performed a systematic review of literature focused on avian responses during ECEs to better understand: 1) how the literature is defining ECEs (correctly or incorrectly), and 2) are there biases in reporting ECE impacts on birds? In June-July of 2024, we collected published literature from the Web of Science and Scopus using a Boolean search string that was established with the R package litsearchr. All articles identified from a naïve search went through an initial abstract review with systematic inclusion criteria (n = 630), and a subsequent full-text review with improved inclusion criteria (n = 237). Ultimately, we identified 123 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. Research on avifauna responses to ECEs spanned 50 countries, and included events such as hurricanes, droughts, and sub-freezing winter storms. Data gathered from these articles will provide refined criteria on researching ECEs and biases in reporting specific bird groups, types of ECEs, or geographical regions.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
141,Comparing Presence/Absence Methods for Detecting Montezuma Quail,"Abstract: Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae) are one of the most understudied gamebird species in North America. They can be found mainly in Mexico but also in certain areas of Arizona, New Mexico, and the Edwards Plateau and Trans-Pecos regions of Texas. Their unique coloration and behavior of crouching or flushing at the last second makes them difficult to study. We assessed 2 different presence/absence survey methods to determine which has a greater detection rate. The first method was the use of autonomous recording units (ARUs) to obtain acoustic recordings. The second method was visual detection of digs. The study was conducted on the Davis Mountains Preserve in Jeff Davis County. We randomly selected locations to place 20 ARUs. Each ARU recorded every day at 10 minute per hour intervals for 3 hours beginning at sunrise. We walked transects within a 200m-diameter circle around each ARU and documented dig presence. We used BirdNET to analyze ARU data that was recorded 3 days prior to each dig survey. Out of the 20 ARUs, we checked 16 of them twice and 4 of them once. There were a total of 22 detections, 8 of which had only vocalizations, 9 had only digs, and 5 had both detection methods. Using the Jaccard index statistic, we calculated a 0.227 similarity between vocalization and dig presence. Therefore, combining both methods is the best approach for evaluating the presence of Montezuma quail.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
142,Dispersal Movements of Marked Harris’s Hawks Among Territories in South Texas,"Abstract: Previous research has demonstrated that juvenile Harris’s Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) throughout their range delay dispersal and remain in their natal territory for 12 to 36 mo. We have captured Harris’s Hawks with bal-chatri traps and marked them with coded anodized bands in south Texas since 2018. Also, at accessible nests, we banded nestlings with coded bands. In most years (2018-2023), we attempted to census territories in both spring/summer and winter and re-sight banded hawks. We have documented that some juvenile and adult auxiliary Harris’s Hawk group members do not remain with the groups in which they were originally marked. We have observed the apparent integration of (43) hawks into different groups from 2018 to 2023. When comparing mean distances moved for the hawks related to age, we found that the average dispersal distance for nestlings was 8.30 km (range of 3.54-17.86 km, sample size of 5), the average distance moved for juveniles was 8.90 km (range of 1.45-20.12 km, sample size of 12), and the average distance moved for adults was 11.82 km (range of 1.61-71.94 km, sample size of 26). There was no significant difference in the average distance moved between nestlings/juveniles and that of adults (P = 0.784). Males dispersed further (mean = 11.92 km) than females (mean = 7.76 km), but this difference was not significant (P= 0.362). Our findings seem contrary to the reported male-biased philopatry observed in most species of birds.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
143,Differential Sex-based Winter Foraging Strategies of American Kestrels in North Texas,"Abstract: American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) exhibit sexual dimorphism, with females being about 10% larger than males. Previous studies have highlighted the ecological implications of sexual dimorphism in birds, particularly in relation to foraging behavior. However, the specific winter foraging strategies influenced by sex in American Kestrels remain unclear. In this study, we utilized radio telemetry to track kestrels within their wintering home ranges in Denton County, Texas and conducted 30-min spot- observation sessions on marked individuals. We recorded data on six males during 30 spot-observation sessions and five females during 44 observation sessions. Analysis revealed females made a mean of 4.7 foraging attempts/30 min, while males made a mean of 3.4 attempts. Additionally, females exhibited a higher average foraging success rate, with 26.2% of foraging attempts resulting in prey capture, compared to a 25.8% average success rate for males. Prey selection differed between sexes. Males preferred invertebrates (90%) as well as taking rodents (5%) and birds (5%). Crawfish made up half of the invertebrates from one male. Meanwhile, females predominantly chose invertebrates (95.5%), while rarely preferring birds (4.5%). Invertebrates constituted a substantial part of both male and female kestrel’s diet. Our results are somewhat contrary to the intersexual-competition hypothesis proposed to explain reverse sexual dimorphism in raptors, as both sexes appear to employ a generalist and efficient foraging strategy in the winter. Quantifying sex-specific foraging behaviors in the winter is essential for understanding the ecological and population dynamics of this declining species.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA

Here, we examined how selected variables may affect the condition of the American Kestrels over their wintering period. We captured primarily wintering migratory kestrels between 2017 and 2023 from December through February with Bal-chatri traps. We trapped, marked, and measured the wing chord and mass of 125 male and 164 female kestrels. A simple condition index (mass/wing chord) was used to examine how the body condition of kestrels varies through their time wintering in north Texas. We found that month and sex have a significant (P < 0.001) influence on condition index values. Females on average had a higher condition index value (0.63 – 0.68) than males (0.60– 0.63), while both sexes of kestrels (female R 2 = 0.987, male R 2 = 0.964) exhibited a decline in condition over the course of winter. As documented in the literature, female kestrels secure higher-quality open grassland habitats compared to males. As females dominate males and secure higher-quality winter territories, this may explain their ability to maintain a higher winter condition than males. The body condition of both sexes declined by 5 – 7% over the winter season. Kestrels in our north Texas study area migrate north in early March; thus, declining winter body conditions could place kestrels at risk during their energetically demanding spring migration and have negative carry- over effects on their nesting success.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
145,Predator Identity Shapes the Diversity of Larval Amphibians in Ponds from East Texas,"Abstract: Predation and environmental conditions shape populations and communities across ecosystems and have carry-over effects across time. Here, we explored the impact of different top predator regimes (TPR) and abiotic factors (AF) on tadpole species richness (SR) over time, by comparing historical (2007 – 2008) and contemporary (2021 – 2023) surveys, and seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter). We evaluated four TPR: Largemouth bass (B), Green sunfish (G), B and G combined (BG), and salamander/invertebrate predators (SI), and five AF, such as woody debris, canopy cover, vegetation, pond area and depth in 25 ponds in East Texas. In total, we found tadpoles belonging to 11 amphibian species. Ponds with G predators consistently exhibited the lowest SR in all seasons compared to ponds with SI, BG, and B predators. Fall and winter presented lower SR compared to spring and summer. When evaluating the TPR and AF using a multi-model approach, we found that the predator regime is the most influential variable explaining SR variation, outperforming models containing AF. These findings highlight the importance of top predator identity in structuring larval amphibian communities. Ponds with SI predators and to a lesser extent BG and B serve as a biodiversity reservoir for amphibians. From a management perspective, managing the predator identity for larval amphibians has important implications for the overall anuran community and ecosystem. Specifically, managing G ponds is important to mitigate their detrimental effect on tadpole SR, while maintaining SI or even B and BG predators might promote amphibian resilience across the landscape.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
146,Assessing Potential Exposure of Northern Bobwhite to Microplastic Pollution,"Abstract: Recently, exposure of wildlife to microplastic (MP) pollution has received increasing attention. Ingestion of MPs may result in physical effects including obstruction of the digestive tract leading to a false sense of satiety. Concomitantly, chemicals associated with MPs may serve as endocrine disruptors with the potential to alter behavior, breeding success, and survival. Most research in this regard has focused on marine birds, yet relatively little is known about the exposure of terrestrial birds to MPs and the associated effects. Moreover, of the limited studies conducted in terrestrial systems, most have considered birds in human-disturbed areas where MP pollution is presumably relatively high. Given atmospheric deposition is likely a major transportation pathway for MPs, birds in less-disturbed areas far from point sources of MP pollution may also be exposed. In South Texas the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; bobwhite) inhabits relatively undisturbed rangelands. Yet, whether bobwhite are exposed to, and potentially negatively affected by MP pollution is unknown warranting further investigation. As a first step to addressing this knowledge gap, we will evaluate MP exposure of bobwhite in South Texas by examining MP loads in digestive and respiratory tracts from hunter-harvested birds, thereby exploring multiple pathways of exposure (i.e., ingestion and inhalation). By providing insight into (1) whether bobwhite are at risk from MP pollution, and (2) the potential pathways by which bobwhite are exposed, results from this project can be used to inform future studies that evaluate the consequences of exposure for this economically important species in South Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
147,"Painted Bunting Distribution: A Spot Map Report for LLELA Nature Preserve, 2024","Abstract: The painted bunting (Passerina ciris) is a brightly colored songbird native to the southeastern United States, Mexico, and Central America. Males of the species display vivid plumage in shades of blue, red, and green, while females and juveniles have more muted colors, showcasing sexual dimorphism. Male painted buntings exhibit highly territorial behavior during the breeding season, using a combination of vocalizations, displays, and physical confrontations to establish, maintain, and defend their territories. To better understand the species' territorial boundaries and population density, as well as social patterns like overlap, clustering, and isolation, sixteen spot maps were created—eight for each of two grid systems within the LLELA Nature Preserve. Data for these maps were collected by recording vocalizations of Passerina ciris during the early morning hours, shortly after sunrise, which aligns with the species' peak activity. During the 2024 summer season, territories often overlapped slightly, with males coexisting at the edges of their territories. Sustainable habitat conditions within the grid systems resulted in areas with high territory density. In the Barn Owl Ridge grid, the densest territories were found between lines Z–C (horizontal) and 4–8 (vertical). In the Bison Ridge grid, the highest density occurred between lines C–F (horizontal) and 3–6 (vertical). These dense pockets are likely due to suitable habitat and proximity to observation feeders. Understanding the dynamics of painted bunting male territories provides valuable insight into their breeding ecology and can inform conservation efforts, especially in areas where habitat destruction threatens their populations.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
148,Effects of Particulate Matter2.5 on Monarch Butterfly Oviposition Preference,"Abstract: Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) have experienced considerable population decline in the United States and Mexico, but the primary factor for their decline is heavily debated. Particulate matter (PM2.5), which primarily comes from the combustion of gas, oil, and fuel has been shown to impact the oviposition preferences of other herbivorous insects. Our goal was to find if particulate matter levels around urban greenspaces impacted site preference for oviposition of monarchs. We measured the number of neonates per milkweed (the preferred host plant for monarchs) from 15 sites in the Chicagoland area, surveying common milkweed (A. syriaca), swamp milkweed (A. incarnata), and prairie milkweed (A. sullivantii). Each site was visited twice, and the average PM2.5 level from the week of data collection was drawn from the air quality monitoring database on Purple Air’s website. Analysis in R-Studio found a statistically insignificant positive correlation between observed PM2.5 and Monarchs/Plant at a site (r2 = 0.097, p = 0.094). This surprising positive correlation may be due to fewer available green spaces and/or milkweeds in areas with the greatest pollution. Since the monarch population fluctuates annually, using data that spans many years will better indicate the relationship between PM2.5 and monarch health. Future goals include using more air quality monitors to allow for a greater data pool and observe the impacts of other aspects of air quality, such as other forms of particulate matter and ozone, on monarchs.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
149,Population and Spatial Ecology of Collared Peccary in the South Texas Plains,"Abstract: Collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), also known as javelina, are a game species occurring in certain parts of Texas. Despite being a game species, information needed to guide collared peccary management is sparse. There is evidence that populations may be declining in Texas, and the reasons are not well understood. Our work includes four focal areas aimed at improving our understanding of collared peccary ecology and increasing public interest in the species, which will aid research and conservation efforts. First, we will evaluate cameras, roadside, and helicopter survey methods for estimating abundance of collared peccary in South Texas. Second, we will develop models of population dynamics as it relates to population abundance, harvest, survival, and reproduction. Third, we will develop habitat suitability models for collared peccary across South Texas using spatially referenced data collected during camera and helicopter surveys and from GPS collared animals at six study sites. Fourth, we will develop educational media to elicit public interest in collard peccary management. These efforts will identify factors related to distribution, survival, reproduction, and abundance of collared peccary, create user friendly tools (e.g. maps and web-based population models), and allow Texas Parks and Wildlife Department biologists and private landowners to effectively manage collared peccary.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
150,Factors Influencing Diets of Wild Pigs (Sus scrofa) in the Neches River Basin of the Piney Woods Region of Texas,"Abstract: Few studies have observed the diet composition, diversity of diets, and range use of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in the United States, and most have had specific objectives towards agriculture production. Our objectives were to document the diet composition of wild pigs in the Neches River Basin of the Piney Woods region of Texas seeking to make specific inference about factors prompting changes in diet among animals throughout the year to determine influence of environmental factors throughout each calendar season and determine influence of age, sex, and pregnancy status on diets as a method of better understanding range and habitat use in this region. We collected samples of stomach contents from wild pigs harvested by personnel at the Boggy Slough Conservation Area, and neighboring property. A total of 84 wild pigs were sampled spread across a 12-month sampling period, March 2023-February 2024. All samples were processed to identify the diversity of items consumed and the abundance of each food item consumed from each individual sampled. We found that seasonal factors had a significant impact (P=0.001) on the diets of individuals across all wild pigs. As temperatures increased, the diversity of diets decreased, but the abundance of all food items varied throughout the sampled population. Results also showed that age had significance (P=8.206e-05) in the diversity of a wild pig’s diet, with sub-adults and juveniles’ diets being less diverse than those of adults. There was no significant difference found in diets between males and females or bred and non-bred females (P- values).",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
151,"Unified Approach to Managing Wild Pigs in US National Parks: Evaluation, Review, and Implementation.","Abstract: Invasive species are in direct opposition to the mission of the National Park Service (NPS) to conserve nature and history. One species in particular, the wild pig (Sus scrofa), significantly damages ecological, cultural, and historical resources as well as impacts visitor experience and NPS operations. Wild pigs are expanding their presence in North America, both in range and abundance. Successful management relies on a well-developed and structured plan, coordination with the public, and a constant eye on invasion. With a total of 431 properties across the nation and about 40 of those reporting the presence of wild pigs as of 2023, efforts to manage wild pigs have been inconsistent and disjunct across parks. We aim to create a unified approach for wild pig management in NPS; we will achieve this by reviewing the presence of wild pigs in NPS, assessing park experience with wild pig management–focusing on successes and obstacles–and evaluating the relationships between park attributes and successful management methods. Several pilot parks who represent a diversity of ecosystems, resource and administrative capacities, and management priorities will test the unified management plan, helping us finalize it to ensure it has the flexibility to adapt to the variety of park attributes. This project will unify wild pig management within NPS and contextualize the use of an adaptable natural resource management plan across a diversity of public lands.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
152,Economic Assessment of Losses to Bird Predation on Aquaculture Farms in Texas,"Abstract: Bird predation poses a significant economic challenge to aquaculture producers in Texas where avian species target fish stocks. This wildlife damage complicates the conservation of such avian species, as well as sustainable, farmed production of fish species for human consumption. It is essential to rigorously examine impacts to aquaculture production from specific piscivorous bird species to provide for precision wildlife damage management. Most research to date focuses on aquaculture in the southeastern United States. By contrast, this project aims to identify the most problematic species affecting coastal aquaculture farmers and estimate the economic losses on those farms. We evaluate the costs associated with bird predation on Texas coastal aquaculture farms using an economic modeling approach that considers estimates of abundance of fish-eating birds, with diet analysis across fish-eating bird species on a variety of aquaculture production operations on the middle gulf coast of Texas to ensure an accurate representation of avian predation to aquaculture in this region. This project covers a wide range of properties, ranging from more inland to directly on the coast, which in turn will provide an opportunity to sample a variety of piscivorous birds. By quantifying the consumption patterns and economic impact of bird predation on aquaculture operations, this research provides valuable insights for farm managers to develop efficient strategies for managing avian predation in aquaculture settings, thereby ensuring the long-term viability of the industry in Texas.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
153,Progressing Rangeland Management Through Drone-Based Data Acquisition for Vegetation Cover Structure,"Abstract: Over the past 50 years, remote sensing has advanced rangeland studies, with recent high-resolution satellites capturing data with greater spatial and temporal detail. Drones have further revolutionized monitoring by linking satellite imagery to fieldwork, enabling precise measurements of vegetation cover, forage biomass, vegetation changes, and wildlife habitats. Drone-derived 3D models and technologies like LiDAR allow for detailed land cover analysis and insights into fine-scale ecological processes. However, evaluating how drone-based sensors interact and integrating their data into rangeland metrics remains a challenge. This study aims to assess the relationship between field vegetation data and drone remote sensors (e.g., hyperspectral, multispectral, LiDAR). Research will be conducted at La Copita Demonstration Research Area (Jim Wells County) and K Bar D Ranch (Bosque County), focusing on land cover types and vegetation structure (e.g., plant height, density). Approximately 80-100 locations will be marked using satellite imagery, followed by drone-based image collection. Field vegetation cover data will be gathered using traditional techniques, supplemented by 3D vegetation structure captured via a terrestrial mobile station. These results will inform methods to help ranchers and managers use drone data more efficiently to assess rangeland productivity and sustainability.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
154,Is Bigger Always Better? Comparison of GPS Collars and Solar-Powered GPS Ear Tags for Animal Movement Studies,"Abstract: Animal-borne tracking systems have provided unique insights into when, where, why, and how animals move and interact with the environment. GPS neck collars have been the standard for animal tracking studies, especially for mid to large- size mammals. However, new technological developments have helped to miniaturize tracking devices (e.g., GPS ear tags), including battery size and longevity (e.g., using solar panels). We initiated this study to quantify the difference in horizontal error and data loss between GPS Vectronic Aerospace collars and solar-powered GPS mOOvement version 1 ear tags during stationary testing and while deployed on beef cows (Bos taurus). Mean horizontal error was 41 m (± 1.8 SE) and 2 m (± 0.1 SE) for GPS ear tags and collars during stationary testing, respectively; during animal testing, the distance between paired ear tag and collar locations was 59.2 m (± 3.3 SE). Fix acquisition was 99.8% ± 0.2 SE for collars and 99.3% ± 0.3 SE for ear tags during stationary testing. During animal deployment, fix acquisition changed to 100% and 30.7% (± 9.1 SE) for collar and ear tags, respectively. Lower acquisition rates, driven by loss of battery life, and greater horizontal error of GPS ear tags, while on animals, may introduce bias into estimates of movement and space use; GPS collars appear to be less sensitive to these forms of bias. However, mOOvement GPS ear tag systems are more economical than commercially manufactured GPS collars. Therefore, budgetary constraints, data resolution, and study objectives will dictate which technology to use.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
155,Calling Behavior of the American Woodcock in Eastern Texas,"Abstract: The American woodcock (Scolopax minor) is found in forested habitats across eastern North America, with eastern Texas representing the southwestern most part of their breeding range. The woodcock has a unique courtship display which begins with “peent” calls and continues with a spiraling flight that is audible to the human ear. We utilized ARUs (automated recording units) to record American woodcock vocalizations and flight displays on the Sam Houston National Forest Wildlife Management Area in eastern Texas from 19 January through 25 March 2023 and from 15 November 2023 through 14 February 2024. In early 2023, we detected American woodcock at 19 of 20 sites and in late 2023/early 2024 we detected American woodcock at 17 of 18 sites. Peent calls and courtship flights were detected at 16 of 20 sites in 2023 and 15 of 18 sites in late 2023/early 2024. Although our ARUs were not deployed in time to determine the date of first calling in 2023, the last vocalization of the season was detected on 5 March 2023. In late 2023/early 2024, the first detected vocalization was on the first day ARUs were deployed, November 15, 2023. This represents a potential 110-day window of display activity for American woodcock. In our study, woodcock were detected at nearly all our survey sites suggesting that the species was common and widespread across the Sam Houston National Forest in 2023 and 2024. Future work should focus on the effects of abiotic factors and forest management on woodcock habitat use.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
156,How are Environmental Factors Influencing Hatching Failure in House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) Along a Latitudinal Gradient?,"Abstract: Hatching failure is a common phenomenon in wild birds, with an average 10% of produced eggs failing to hatch due to either fertilization failure or embryo mortality. The mechanisms behind wild passerine embryo mortality remain complex. For optimal embryonic development, eggs require a relatively constant internal temperature of 36º–40° C. However, ambient environmental conditions may vary across development and have a strong influence on embryo growth. When temperatures remain above the optimal temperature, embryo growth and mortality is often influenced. Due to climate change, temperature and the frequency of extreme weather events are predicted to increase, which could result in reduced reproductive success in passerines. In this study, we investigated hatching failure using a model species, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), across 4 sites along a latitudinal gradient in the USA from Texas to North Dakota. We predicted that hatching failure would be higher in the lower latitudes due to higher mean daily temperatures, less rainfall, and increased relative humidity. We examined site-specific environmental differences during the incubation period such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity, distinguished between infertility and early embryo mortality, and used embryonic staging to estimate the embryos death date. We will run logistic regression mixed models to examine the influence of temperature, precipitation, and humidity on hatching failure across latitudes. This study will address how environmental fluctuations could contribute to reduced reproductive success in a model species with conservation management implications in response to climate change.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
157,Call Me a Peccary or Javelina but Do Not Call Me a Pig,"Abstract: Collared peccary (Dicotyles tajacu; family Tayassuidae), also called javelina, are a native game species in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Despite being a game species, javelina are not well studied and are often confused with non-native feral hogs (Sus scrofa). To educate the public about javelina ecology and management, we are developing extension materials such as fact sheets, posters, and technical articles that can be distributed widely. In Texas, javelina are distributed across the South Texas Plains, Trans Pecos, Edwards Plateau, and Rolling Plains ecoregions. Javelina are characterized by a ring of white and gray hair around their neck, which resembles a collar, giving rise to the name, collared peccary. Javelina weigh 48-50 pounds when mature, breed year-round starting at 11 months if conditions are favorable, and have a 145-day gestation period, producing up to two litters of typically two young. Javelina are omnivores, feeding on prickly pear (Opuntia sp.), roots, mesquite beans (Prosopis sp.), forbs, and insects. Javelina are semi-territorial with home ranges that typically cover 90 to 364 ha, depending on the vegetation community and forage availability. Increasing awareness and appreciation for javelina will aid the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in managing the species by fostering greater involvement and support from the public. Additionally, this will also provide valuable data on population dynamics, helping estimate size, trends, and changes over time. We summarize this information in a new Texas A&M AgriLife fact sheet, which will be made available to conference attendees using a QR code.",poster,Student Poster Abstracts,2025,NA
158,The Isotopic Niche of Alligator Snapping Turtles in East Texas,"Abstract: The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) occurs across the southeastern United States, but fundamental aspects of its ecology, such as its trophic ecology, are still lacking across much of its extensive range. Stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) are elemental tracers that can be used to track energetic pathways and infer trophic position of consumers within food webs. We contributed to the knowledge on the trophic ecology of Macrochelys temminckii by using stable isotope ratios of δ13C and δ15N in tissues collected from basal resources and consumers (fishes, turtles) in three streams in East Texas (Alazan Wildlife Management Area, Shawnee, and Attoyac) where the focal species is known to occur. Tissue collections occurred from May to August 2023, including from 31 individuals of M. temminckii (average straight line carapace length = 36.0 cm; range =13.0 to 58.4 cm). Macrochelys temminckii collected from Alazan appeared to occupy a narrower isotopic niche compared to individuals collected from Shawnee and Attoyac. Stable isotope ratios of carbon suggest that M. temminckii are supported by autochthonous (e.g., seston) rather than allochthonous (e.g., terrestrial plants) basal resources. Based on vertical position occupied by centrarchids, catfishes, and turtles, and their nitrogen ratios enrichment, these consumers appear to be important prey supporting M. temminckii. Sampling across broader spatial and temporal extents will provide context as to the variability in their isotopic niche. The isotopic niche variation across sites suggests that M. temminckii is a generalist consumer in their habitats. 61. American Kestrel Nesting Habitat and Nestling Provisioning in the West Gulf Coastal Plain Richard Schaefer, USDA Forest Service, Nacogdoches, TX, USA Abstract: Both migrant and resident populations of the American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) occur in the West Gulf Coastal Plain (WGCP). Migrants/winter residents belong to the nominate subspecies sparverius. They arrive in the WGCP in late August to early October and are mostly gone by late April. The resident population belongs to the subspecies paulus of the southeastern United States, and reaches the western limit of its range in the WGCP. This subspecies, known as the Southeastern American Kestrel, has declined in many areas, and there has been little research in the western portion of its range. Most kestrel nests (84%) were located in forest stands managed for the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Dryobates borealis). We compared nest site (n = 44) and random site (n = 44) habitat variables. Kestrel nesting habitat contained fewer canopy and midstory trees, less canopy and midstory closure, greater herbaceous and woody ground cover, and less bare soil and leaf litter. Shrub height was similar between nest sites and random sites, but shrub density was greater around nest sites. These habitat characteristics are typical of sites where forest thinning and prescribed fire are used to manage Red-cockaded Woodpecker habitat. We recorded 509 prey deliveries (males = 269, females = 240) to nest sites by breeding kestrels. Most vertebrate prey was delivered by males (81%), with green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) being the most common prey item (n = 140). Females delivered mostly invertebrates (87%), and grasshoppers were the most common prey item (n = 76). 62. Terrestrial Observations of Alligator Snapping Turtles in Texas Josh Pierce, USDA Forest Service, Nacogdoches, TX, USA Jessica Glasscock, Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX, USA Cord Eversole, Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX, USA Matt Buckingham, US Fish and Wildlife, Nacogdoches, USA Christopher Schalk, USDA Forest Service, Nacogdoches, TX, USA Abstract: Despite being the largest freshwater turtle in North America, observations of terrestrial activity of the Alligator Snapping Turtle (Macrochelys temminckii; AST) are limited. This species is highly aquatic, with terrestrial movements most often attributed to nesting activity of females. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently proposed to list AST as federally threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The use of terrestrial habitats has implications for identifying nesting habitat and movement corridors for the species. This can have implications for establishing buffer areas to protect nesting animals and habitat, for example. Thus, we synthesized reported terrestrial AST observations in Texas, in the context of time of year (day), distance to water (m), and distance to nearest road (m). To date, we have collected 34 potential terrestrial observations, 3 of which are confirmed nesting attempts. The majority of (~76%) the observations were during April–June, with ~74% being <60m of water (range = 0–295m). Thirty-two percent of the observations were documented on roads. These data have implications for mitigation of proposed activities such as timber harvest or infrastructure construction or maintenance in or near AST habitats. 63. Variations in Species Temporal Partitioning Based on Bat Community Structure Madison Gover, Texas State University, Burleson, TX, USA Madison Nadler, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA Maria Ramirez, Texas State University, New Braunfels, TX, USA Sarah Fritts, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA Abstract: Niche partitioning minimizes interspecific competition among sympatric species across multiple dimensions. Insectivorous bats exhibit evolutionary adaptations in foraging strategies, prey selection, echolocation, and wing morphology. Species further partition spatially and temporally. In Texas, Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis; TABR) form colonies often numbering millions. We investigated whether sympatric bats adjust their temporal acoustic activity in areas with dense TABR calls. We hypothesized that insectivorous bats sharing airspace with large TABR populations adjust their activity to reduce competition. We studied four sympatric species: two that often roost with TABR - cave myotis (Myotis velifer; MYVE) and tri-colored bat (Perimyotis subflavus; PESU) and two that rarely do - evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis; NYHU) and hairy-tailed bats (Lasiurus spp.; REDS) Sites were categorized by TABR echolocation call density: ≥50% or <50% of total calls. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we surveyed bats across 48 locations with 84 acoustic monitors across Texas over three summers (2021-2023). We classified bat calls to species and then examined acoustic activity between species’ calls using kernel density functions and overlap coefficients. Results suggest varying degrees of temporal overlap and behavioral shifts between TABR density categories, suggesting MYVE and PESU may alter their temporal activity to avoid high traffic airspace compared to the tree-roosting NYHU and REDS. Activity time distributions differed across species and years with adequate sample sizes (p < 0.001). This may suggest that REDS and NYHU are altering their airspace usage in response to TABR density, albeit their diel activity is not as affected. 64. Does Restoration of a Riparian Area Affect Songbird Populations and Communities? Cameron Starnes, Tarleton State University, Kyle, USA Zachary Bellows, Stephenville, TX, USA Heather Mathewson, Tarleton State University, Stephenville, TX, USA Abstract: Restoration of riparian and grassland areas is necessary to remove woody vegetation encroachment; however, this restoration can cause substantial disturbance to a system. This disturbance, or change in land cover, could negatively or positively affect species such as songbirds. Some bird species might benefit from opening the canopy and increasing edge habitat, but others might require the dense canopy cover. Our objective is to evaluate how disturbance from habitat restoration might affect songbird populations, species richness, and community diversity in riparian areas adjacent to a juniper-encroached grassland system. We conducted our study at Palo Pinto Mountains State Park, located in Palo Pinto and Stephens County, Texas from 2019–2024. The park is approximately 1,971 ha and is actively managed for increased stream flow through the removal of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) along riparian areas and re-seeding efforts of native forbs and grasses. We have a treated site where juniper was removed in 2020 and 2021 and a control site that has received no disturbance. We conduct avian point counts during the spring, summer, and late fall early winter. At each point, we survey for 10 minutes and record species detections, both audio and visual, as well as distance and direction of the detections, and weather conditions such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloud cover. This study will help us better understand how necessary restoration efforts affect songbird populations. 65. Grassland Habitat for Pollinators under Various Mowing Regimes at the Fort Davis National Historic Site Eliana Dykehouse, Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Maureen Frank, Borderlands Research Institute - Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Justin French, Borderlands Research Institute - Sul Ross State University, Alpine, TX, USA Abstract: Habitat loss and fragmentation are contributing to the global decline of pollinators, and species native to fragile desert ecosystems such as the Chihuahuan Desert are especially susceptible to these changes. Pollinators require structural heterogeneity for shelter, native flowering plants for pollen and nectar, and specific host plants for egg laying and larval rearing. Mowing, which removes floral resources and reduces structural diversity, is a management practice used to improve safety and visibility in areas of interest for tourism. Deferred or reduced mowing, however, can benefit pollinators and other insects. Managers at the Fort Davis National Historic Site are interested in balancing tourism goals with natural resource conservation through mowing regimes. Four treatment areas have been implemented at the site: deferred mowing, mowed regularly during monsoon season and as needed, mowed once in the fall, and deferred mowing with prescribed fire and mechanical brush removal. Our study objective is to quantify the impacts of the various mowing regimes on grassland vegetation and pollinator communities. We evaluated plant and insect pollinators at 75 plots across the four treatments in the summers of 2023 and 2024. To survey bees and beetles, we used bee bowl traps placed at the center of each plot and collected them after a 24-hour period. We caught caterpillars using sweep nets, and to measure butterfly density, we used remote cameras programmed to take 10-second videos twice an hour. To determine how insect community composition varies among treatments, we will analyze our data using principal coordinate analysis. 66. Fast Food or Fine Dining? Foraging Behavior of Male White-tailed Deer During the Rut Ethan Garcia, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute - Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Alice, TX, USA Aaron Foley, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute - Texas A&M University - Kingsville, Kingsville, TX, USA Abstract: Male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are capital breeders in a scramble competition mating system characterized by competitive mate-searching. The accumulation of endogenous fat reserves prior to the rut allows for the reduction in time spent foraging during the breeding season. Mature males have completed skeletal growth and are able to store more fat than young males, which partially explains why mature males sire most offspring. Despite the evidence that reduction in foraging time translates into increases in breeding success, there is insufficient empirical data on male foraging behavior during the rut which limits the ability to further inferences. To improve our understanding of male foraging behavior, we placed 10 trail cameras in a 92-ha high-fenced site in Kingsville, Texas, USA that is dominated by a native shrub community. Cameras were programmed to record motion-triggered videos and will be deployed for the duration of the breeding season (November 2024 – January 2025). Each camera was positioned in front of multiple browse species, with and without thorns, that are preferred forage for white-tailed deer. The variety of preferred browse species with a gradient of plant processing time within the same viewshed should provide insight into male foraging strategies. We will examine the change in proportion of time spent foraging by male age class and whether proportion of time spent foraging differed between brush species with and without thorns. Our results will provide insights into the trade-off between energy intake and reproductive effort.

159,Resource Selection of a Recolonizing Population of Black Bears in a Desert Landscape,"Abstract: Black bears (Ursus americanus) once occurred throughout most of North America, but because of predator control and habitat fragmentation populations declined in the early 1900s. With improved public attitudes, demographic adaptability, and effective management practices, black bear populations persisted in forested areas and temperate, montane regions with high cover. Black bear populations in Texas, however, differ as they occur in a desert environment in the western part of the state, where foraging opportunities are seasonally limited. Further, bears are naturally recolonizing Texas after decades of absence and are returning to a significantly human- altered landscape. To better understand how bears are using available resources in this altered landscape, we sought to examine resource selection by capturing and fitting GPS collars on 32 black bears in west Texas from 2022–2024. We hypothesize that resource availability is seasonally influencing black bear movements with a particular focus on climatic, habitat, and anthropogenic variables. Specifically, we hypothesize that bears will select high-quality vegetative resources, and that resource selection will vary between foraging seasons, and be influenced by drought. Lastly, we hypothesize that bears will demonstrate functional responses to anthropogenic features, such as roads and more developed areas. Black bears face numerous challenges as they continue to recolonize Texas, including a changing climate, increased security measures along the US-Mexico border, and increased access to anthropogenic resources. Understanding resource selection can greatly inform management decisions to increase human-bear coexistence.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
160,Environmental Drivers and Habitat Preferences of Breeding American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis),"Abstract: Reproductive ecology is one of the most heavily researched aspects of a species' life history, as reproductive success is crucial to their development, distribution, and survival. In the case of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), researchers have shown that the characteristics of breeding and nesting habitats play a significant role in their presence within wetland ecosystems. Environmental factors influence alligator distribution, and during the breeding season, their reproductive behavior is marked by highly vocal courtship rituals, making them one of the most vocal crocodylian species. Such vocalizations have yet to be recorded with autonomous recording units (ARUs) to evaluate distribution and habitat use of breeding individuals. Using vocalizations to identify breeding alligators and assess habitat presence can be used for understanding the environmental factors that drive breeding behavior and habitat selection. Therefore, the objective of our study is to determine the efficiency and preferred habitat of breeding American alligator vocalizations in Texas. In this study we will focus on three main questions: 1) Are ARUs effective methods for detecting and documenting American alligator vocalizations; 2) Where does American alligator breeding occur, and how do habitat characteristics vary across these specific breeding sites, and finally 3) What are the environmental drivers of alligator breeding behavior? To answer these questions, we will place 30 ARUs at three study sites and record data on various abiotic and biotic variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, water depth and typology, vegetation cover, salinity, TDS) to determine the breeding habitat preferences of alligators through occupancy modeling.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
161,Comparative Survival of Sympatric Chestnut-bellied Scaled Quail and Northern Bobwhite within the Tamaulipan Biotic Province,"Abstract: Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter “bobwhite”) are two quail species suffering distribution-wide declines that occur sympatrically at the eastern and western periphery of their respective distributions. Influences of demographic rates are better understood for bobwhite than for scaled quail, and studies quantifying survival of both species in areas of sympatry are limited. Understanding how environmental variables influence different species within shared space is essential to conservation biology. Consequently, sympatric populations provide valuable opportunities for survival studies, as biological and environmental factors may have disparate effects on interacting species. In South Texas, the chestnut-bellied scaled quail (C. squamata castanogastris) is sympatric with bobwhite throughout much of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province, a system characterized by a patchwork of densely populated and diverse thornscrub shrublands. This system has undergone extreme fragmentation and degradation, likely resulting in decreased demographic rates. We conducted a capture-mark-recapture study at two sites within areas of sympatry to explore comparative survival for chestnut-bellied scaled quail and bobwhite, as well as to identify key biological and environmental covariates that influence their survival. From 2022 to 2024, we captured 967 scaled quail and 263 bobwhite, of which 469 scaled quail and 127 bobwhite were recaptured in subsequent sampling periods. We will integrate these data into a hierarchical Bayesian version of Pollock’s Robust Design model to estimate survival. These results will augment existing knowledge of survival dynamics between scaled quail and bobwhite, providing insight relevant to conservation and management strategies in the fragmented thornscrub ecosystem.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
162,Everything that Glitters is not Gold: Investigating Solar-powered GPS Ear Tags for Wildlife Research,"Abstract: Global positioning system (GPS) technology has become a widely adopted tool in wildlife monitoring and research. Spatial location data can provide unique insights into animal behavior, resource selection, movement patterns, and species interactions. However, GPS data are often flawed by data loss (missing fixes due to failed GPS attempts) and horizontal error (discrepancy between recorded and true locations), which, if not accounted for, can lead to biased estimates of space use, movement, and resource selection. We evaluated the performance of solar-powered GPS ear tags (mOOvement, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia) during stationary tests in southern Texas to determine their efficacy for wildlife research. Using generalized linear mixed models, we examined the effects of woody cover (%) and the distance (m) between tags and the long-range wireless antenna on fix success (%) and horizontal error (m). At site 1, fix success was negatively correlated with distance to antenna and percentage of woody cover, but unaffected by these covariates at site 2. Horizontal error was influenced by distance to the antenna at site 2 whereby horizontal error decreased as the distance between the antenna and tag increased. When a subset (n = 6) of tags was deployed on collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), all tags ceased sending fixes after eight days and averaged only 35% fix success. Our findings highlight practical considerations for using solar-powered GPS ear tags for wildlife research. We suggest researchers consider the landscape and ecological characteristics of the study species before deploying GPS units, especially those relying on solar power.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
163,Quantifying Greater Sandhill Crane Migratory and Population Connectivity Using Molecular Techniques,"Abstract: Greater Sandhill Cranes (Antigone canadensis tabida) in the Intermountain West are managed as three separate populations: Central Valley (CVP), Lower Colorado River Valley (LCRVP), and Rocky Mountain (RMP). Telemetry data from over 120 tagged cranes show significant overlap in summer, migration, and wintering areas, but this approach is limited by scale, cost, and logistical constraints. The goal of this study is to use molecular techniques to assess population overlap and migratory connectivity among the CVP, RMP, and LCRVP in the Intermountain West. Our objectives are to: 1) quantify connectivity and genomic overlap using microsatellite markers to determine population structure and interactions; 2) compare molecular data with geospatial data from tagged cranes; 3) assess whether stable isotope signatures can identify areas of population overlap; and 4) determine sex ratios to better understand population dynamics. Samples include secondary feathers from 25 crane colts and 356 adults collected from 2015-2024. We hypothesize that: 1) microsatellite markers will identify distinct genetic clusters with defined connectivity patterns; 2) molecular and geospatial data will strongly correlate enabling precise geographic mapping of genetic variation; 3) stable isotopes signatures will effectively pinpoint geographic overlap areas, reflecting movement and habitat use; and 4) DNA analysis will reveal balanced sex ratios, providing insights into population dynamics and social structure. Preliminary data and literature support the first two hypotheses, and ongoing efforts focus on quantifying genetic overlap and validating objectives two and three. This integrative approach will enhance understanding of population connectivity and inform conservation strategies.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
164,Unlocking the Potential of Canopy Camera Traps to Enhance Vertebrate Surveys in Urban Areas,"Abstract: Camera traps provide key information for wildlife management and conservation. However, camera traps have been traditionally restricted to ground level. In the last decade, researchers started using camera traps in the canopy, a frontier in vertebrate knowledge. These seminal publications revealed interesting findings, such as a significant increase in overall mammal inventories. From our knowledge, no previous research in urban areas in the US used camera traps in the canopy. Previous studies using camera traps on the ground of the urban regions in the US revealed lower activity of some animals when it was expected otherwise, e.g., the Virginia opossum. We aim to demonstrate the complementarity of camera traps for wildlife surveys for mammals in a small town in Deep East Texas. We expect similar species richness on the two strata but with different foraging activities. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of recording wildlife detections depending on the camera position and height. We selected five trees (two Southern red oaks, one water hickory, one pecan tree, and one water oak) in an urban park and a residential area. We climbed the trees using the single rope technique and installed two to three cameras in the canopy and one on the understory right below the selected tree. The cameras in the canopy were positioned towards the horizontal view and the ground, the latter to capture animal activity when climbing. With our results, we will provide new insights into habitat use when monitoring and managing wildlife in urban areas.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
165,Hatch or Fail: Northern Bobwhite Quail & Scaled Quail Attempt at Multiple Nests at RPQRR,"Abstract: This study examines the nesting behavior and success rates of multiple attempts by Northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) and scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) at the Rolling Plains Quail Research Ranch (RPQRR) over a 10-year period (2014–2024). Quail typically will nest from early spring to fall. Our primary objective was to determine whether subsequent nesting attempts were influenced by prior success or failure, to assess preferred nesting substrates, and to analyze the temporal gap between successive nests. We hypothesize that differences will exist in substrate selection and nesting success across attempts. We analyzed data from 210 quail nests, including 167 bobwhite and 43 scaled quail. Of these, 99 birds attempted a second nest, and 9 attempted a third nest. Results indicate no significant differences in the substrates selected for nesting. Success rates were 49.02% for first nests, 46.46% for second nests, and 66.67% for third nests. These findings suggest that while the success rate of second nesting attempts was slightly lower than first attempts, some quail at RPQRR did achieve successful third nesting attempts. These results contribute to our understanding of quail reproductive ecology and will inform management strategies related to habitat and predator control",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
166,Wildlife Disease Research in Texas: Trends Over the Past Three Decades,"Abstract: Texas encompasses a unique geographical region that spans ten ecoregions and hosts a diversity of wildlife. It is also a central point for major bird migratory flyways, hosts > 1930 km of international border with high movement of people and animals, and is situated in a climatic region expected to warm significantly in the next few decades. These factors make Texas a region of interest for understanding wildlife disease emergence and zoonotic disease risk. Here, we reviewed three decades of literature reporting wildlife diseases in Texas to understand regional and temporal trends. We utilized the Web of Science platform to perform a literature review using the following search terms and Boolean operators: “disease” AND “wildlife” AND “Texas”, which returned 772 primary research articles as of September 2023. These were filtered by a strict set of criteria to identify >90 primary articles. We noted a gradual increase in disease research in Texas with most studies focused on cervids, feral species (e.g., Sus scrofa), and species at the urban-wild interface (e.g., coyotes [Canis latrans] and raccoons [Procyon lotor]). Pathogens that were most prevalent in the literature were vector-borne, including Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease). Zoonotic diseases comprised >50% of the literature reviewed. We acknowledge that, in part, this trend reflects researcher interests and funding opportunities; however, it shouldn’t diminish the importance of Texas as a geographically important region with species distributions shifting northward (e.g., the northward movement of vampire bats) and vectors experiencing less seasonality with climate change.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
167,Status and Trend of Texas Horned Lizards in the United States from 2014 – 2024,"Abstract: Texas horned lizards (THL; Phrynosoma cornutum) are an iconic reptile species native to the southwestern United States. We surveyed state wildlife agencies within the distributional range of Texas horned lizards to determine their legal status, current relative abundance, population trends, and distribution of Texas horned lizards during 2014 and 2024. Historically, Texas horned lizards were found within nine south- central states; however, currently (2024), they are found in six states, having been extirpated from Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana. The legal status of Texas horned lizards did not change within individual states during the past decade. Texas horned lizards are listed as state threatened in Texas, protected in Colorado and Oklahoma, and as non-game in New Mexico and Kansas. However, their abundance and population trend did change. In 2014, about 36%, 19%, 29%, and 16% of the THL population was considered increasing, stable, decreasing, and extirpated, respectively, from its historic range. Today, THL population was considered 9%, 41%, 20%, and 30% increasing, stable, decreasing, and extirpated, respectively, from its historic range. The overall population trend of THL during the past decade was a 12% decline from increasing to stable status, 12% decline from stable to decreasing status, and 16% of the population extirpated. If current trends hold for THL through time, then <2% of the THL population will be increasing, while 17% and 22%, respectively, will be exhibiting stable and decreasing trends, and 60% of the THL population will be extirpated within 75 years. Federal listing within the ESA is suggested.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
168,Attitudes of Wildlife Specialists Pertaining to Ownership of Dangerous Wild Animals,"Abstract: The novelty and thrill of owning an exotic animal often stimulates people to acquire one. Laws within most states affirm that dangerous, exotic animals can be privately owned as long as the owner has registered the animal with a state registration agency. However, some people believe that certain exotic animals are too dangerous to be allowed as pets and that such animals pose a threat to the community in which they are kept. We questioned if the average person has sufficient knowledge of potential attack behavior, possible sustained injuries, and risk of zoonotic disease potential from captive wildlife. Therefore, we surveyed 137 wildlife experts who have knowledge and experience with wildlife handling and disease issues to ascertain information about potential of attack, injury, and zoonotic risk. We categorized species (N = 120) that have been known to be or confiscated as pets and placed species into one of 17 animal categories (i.e., big cats, small cats, canid, big bear, small bear, raccoon, weasel, mongoose, ape, prosimian, New world monkey, Old world monkey, ungulate, constrictor, venomous, and crocodile). Experts were consistent in rankings across all animal categories in their beliefs. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of those surveyed believed a likely or high likeliness that all animal categories have potential to attack humans, and 80% believed that if any animal across all categories attacked, it would require hospitalization and be life-threatening. About half of those surveyed (64/137; 47%) believed a zoonotic disease risk exists from wild animal ownership.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
169,Evaluating Caterpillar Use of Drought-Tolerant Landscape Perennials Under Water Restrictions in North-Central Texas,"Abstract: Caterpillars (Lepidoptera) are a major food source for many wildlife species. Most caterpillars are specialized to plants with which they share an evolutionary history. This specialization is primarily due to specific adaptations to tolerate, circumvent, or utilize secondary compounds and defense strategies produced by plants. Declines in insects are documented across the globe with contributing factors including urbanization, intensive agriculture, and climate change. Current climate models predict increased frequency and severity of drought in north-central Texas, where increasing urban populations will exacerbate water limitations in combination with drought; as such, drought-tolerant landscape perennials have been identified to reduce water consumption but caterpillar response to these hosts in the north-central Texas region remains unknown. We seek to examine caterpillar use of drought-tolerant commercially available landscape perennials and determine how caterpillar presence changes across water restrictions. We established 4, 8.5 x 14-m plots with 3, 2 x 14-m rows containing 20 perennial plant taxa. In 2022, we irrigated plants using evapotranspiration rate and a plant factor (PF) of 0.6 for establishment; in 2023 and 2024, we implemented 3 irrigation levels within each block: high (PF = 0.6), low (PF = 0.3), and no supplemental irrigation. In 2024, we conducted bi-weekly caterpillar counts on each plant in each block using a total search approach and identified caterpillars to lowest taxonomic unit. Our findings will identify commercially available perennials that provide resources for caterpillars in landscapes prone to water limitations due to drought and other anthropogenic factors.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
170,Seasonal Dynamics of Anuran Skin Microbiomes at Wild Basin Wilderness Preserve: A Longitudinal Metagenomic Study,"Abstract: The microbial community that inhabits the skin of frogs (the skin microbiome) has been demonstrated to be a critical component of their innate immune system. Disruption of this community (dysbiosis) is associated with susceptibility to pathogenic infection. Environmental stress in the form of prolonged periods of heat and drought can induce dysbiosis and weaken the immune system. During summers in the Texas Hill Country, anurans may be more susceptible to disease due to the coincidence of a weakened immune system, altered microbiome, and conditions that favor the spread of disease. We sampled the microbiome of the native Gulf Coast toad (Incilius nebulifer) and Rio Grande leopard frog (Lithobates berlandieri) across the year to evaluate the relationships among richness, evenness, transience, and variability of the microbiome while also noting the sex, age, and health condition of each individual frog. Collectively, this data will be assessed in the context of climatic change and time of year. Preliminary demographic data concluded relatively high captures of I. nebulifer with high body condition scores and low L. berlandieri captures in the earlier weeks of the year. Vice versa in the later weeks of the year associated with prolonged drought and lower temperatures indicating variance in health of anurans across the year.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
171,Assessing Seasonal Phenology of Ocelot Ranch Population Thornshrub Cover,"Abstract: Drones (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, UAVs) are remote operated devices that can be equipped with sensors and aerial imagery technology which can be used as a more affordable way to gather high-resolution data. This project plans to use the drone’s ability to use LiDAR sensors and a Multispectral camera to examine temporal and spatial changes in vegetation that happen between the winter season and the summer season. This research will explore the seasonal differences in cover, by measuring the changes to the vegetation structure and environment that the seasons bring to the ocelot ranch population’s thornshrub cover. Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) are a federally endangered species in Texas that have a primary habitat of dense brush areas. Ocelots in Texas are confined to two small regions in South Texas. This data gathered will provide a detailed assessment of the habitats suitability for ocelots based on the vegetation at fine spatiotemporal scales. This study aims to compare these ecological parameters of vegetation cover of the established habitat during the winter and summer and how the quality of the habitat changes with the seasons. By mapping the differences in the vegetation density, temperature change, and the spatial cover, we will evaluate the sustainability for future restoration efforts and develop strategies that will allow us to enhance the quality of these patches to hold larger populations for ocelots. The findings will inform conservation strategies aimed at improving habitat restoration to support sustainable ocelot populations in South Texas.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
172,How Does Foraging Enrichment Reduce Maladaptive Behavior in Captive Giraffes?,"Abstract: The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the largest ruminant and the world’s tallest terrestrial animal. Native to sub-Saharan Africa's savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands, giraffes primarily browse leaves, fruits, and flowers from a variety of trees. Giraffes spend over half of their time feeding in the wild and do so hourly. In contrast, giraffes in zoos feed for less time and are usually fed alfalfa and manufactured concentrated feeds, with only occasional browsing. This increases their consumption rate, which limits the exercise of facial muscles and may result in the display of maladaptive behaviors, particularly oral stereotypic behavior. Oral stereotypic behaviors in captive giraffes are repetitive, unvarying patterns in their feeding behaviors that serve no apparent purpose or function in the context in which they occur. These behaviors do not usually occur naturally in the wild. Zoos are still seeking methods for lowering consumption rates and optimizing enrichment techniques for captive giraffes, so their feeding behavior mimics wild populations to a greater degree. We will perform behavioral observations to examine and compare husbandry methodologies at the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center in Glen Rose, Texas. This study will be minimally invasive, and it will consist of visually monitoring giraffe behavior through in-person observation and video to compare enrichment methods. We hope this project will help improve giraffe husbandry and welfare for many institutions holding this charismatic species.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
173,"Evaluating Microplastic Pollutants and Macroinvertebrate Response in the Greater Matagorda Bay Area, Texas","Abstract: Macroinvertebrates (e.g., insects, crustaceans, and gastropods) account for over 75% of all described animal taxa and a play pivotal role in supporting ecosystem integrity; in estuarine environments, macroinvertebrates facilitate water filtration, nutrient cycling, and serve as a crucial food source for wildlife at higher trophic levels. Given their short generation times and sensitivity to environmental perturbance (i.e., changes in turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and pollution), macroinvertebrates serve as bioindicators of change in aquatic ecosystem health, as well as identifying mechanisms contributing to loss of ecosystem structure and function. Microplastic pollution (plastic materials <5 mm) is ubiquitous in aquatic environments, but the long-term effects on estuarine food webs remain unclear. We seek to investigate the multi-trophic impact of microplastics on macroinvertebrate and plant communities, using the greater Matagorda Bay area as a focal system. We collected water, sediment, and tissue samples from macrophytes and macroinvertebrates in Matagorda Bay and adjacent waterways in 2024 and will be analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to determine the presence, type and concentration of microplastic pollutants. Additionally, we will implement a microcosm experiment to assess how macroinvertebrates respond to different densities and concentrations of microplastics at different trophic levels (herbivore, detritivore, and predator). By elucidating how macroinvertebrates interact with and are influenced by microplastic pollution, we seek to identify mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on estuarine ecosystems. Ultimately, we hope that our findings will inform future conservation strategies to incorporate macroinvertebrate biomonitoring in estuarine systems undergoing restoration following microplastic pollution.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
174,Exploring the Impact of Extrafloral Nectaries (EFNs) and Beneficial Arthropods on the Performance of a Common Rangeland Forage Legumes (Fabaceae),"Abstract: Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are accessory glands that can be found on the outer parts of the plant and promote mutualistic relationships with arthropods; the plant provides nectar to ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and other predatory arthropods in return for protection from herbivorous insects. A common rangeland plant family of which EFNs may be found are the legumes (Fabaceae), which have high protein content and are common browse species for wildlife; vetch (Vicia spp.) are reliable source of forage for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and other ungulates during the winter. Our study seeks to explore the relationship between EFNs, herbivorous insects, and beneficial arthropods and how EFNs contribute to plant performance for rangeland forage species. We will establish plantings of three species (Vicia sativa, V. villosa, and Chamaecrista fasciculata) at Tarleton State University’s Agricultural Center in Erath Co. and apply a sealant to block EFNs as a treatment. We will record observations of predatory, herbivorous, and pollinating arthropods that visit plants and compare differences in visitation, abundance, and richness between sealed and unsealed plants and among species. We will also record changes in plant and floral characteristics associated with sealed or unsealed EFNs. Arthropods contribute important ecosystem services to rangelands, such as pollination, nutrient cycling, pest regulation; we seek to bring awareness of the importance of EFNs and their relationship with beneficial arthropods in rangeland ecosystems to improve habitat conditions for wildlife that depend on arthropods, or the forage arthropods impact, for survival.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
175,Assessing Invertebrate Diversity and Abundance Among Rio Grande Wild Turkey Habitats in the Edwards Plateau Ecoregion Using Traditional and Molecular Techniques,"Abstract: Rio Grande wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia; RGWT) require invertebrate prey to fulfill protein and energetic demands associated with critical life periods. In the Edwards Plateau Ecoregion, variable environmental flows create habitat conditions in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that facilitate terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and aquatic invertebrate availability and biomass. No current information exists on the baseline ecological invertebrate components nor invertebrate forage selection by RGWT. We established two paired 40-m transects across upland and riparian habitats at five sites with occurrences of RGWT, three on the South Llano River and two on the North Llano River within the Edwards Plateau Ecoregion of Central Texas. These rivers have contrasting environmental flows; the South fork is perennial while the north fork is intermittent and can experience extended periods of zero flow or complete drying. Sampling transects included three sticky traps, nine pitfall traps, and a 20-m sweep net sample in vegetation, collected every 13-15 days from April – August in 2023 and 2024. We detected more individual invertebrates in riparian habitat and a similar number of invertebrate families among different sampling methods at riparian and upland sites (175 > 165; riparian > upland) with nearly 76% of all collected individual invertebrates represented by three orders (Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera respectively; excluding Isopoda). DNA meta-barcoding will be used to compare species occurrences in RGWT fecal samples to potentially relate to community data. Our research findings will inform strategies for conservation of RGWT, while background invertebrate biodiversity data supports further research and long-term monitoring.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
176,An Automated Approach to Monitoring Herpetofauna on Texas Military,"Abstract: The Texas Military Department (TMD) is responsible for the stewardship of approximately 55,000 acres of training land throughout Texas. The TMD is required to develop and implement an integrated natural resources management plan (INRMP) that is consistent with the military mission while simultaneously maintaining the ecological integrity of the resources within. For military installations under the TMD, the INRMP requires monitoring surveys to manage amphibian and reptile (herpetofauna) populations to ensure the military mission does not threaten the long-term persistence of these species. To aid this process, we were tasked with developing long-term standardized survey protocols at four TMD installations. To accomplish this, we deployed 5 IR-triggered camera trapping arrays and 5 automatic recording devices (ARDs) at each installation. To supplement the automated survey equipment, we also conducted visual encounter surveys (VES) during the spring and fall seasons. During the 2024 season, the cameras captured a total of 3699 snake images (22 species), 1927 lizard images (12 species), 281 anuran images (7 species), and 81 turtle images (1 species) with 662, 414, 46, and 8 unique observations contributing to each group, respectively. The ARDs detected the presence of 27 anuran species. In comparison, the VES yielded 78 snake observations (21 species), 84 lizard observations (10 species), 31 turtle observations (5 species), 105 anuran observations (17 species), and 5 salamander observations (3 species). Here, we expand on our preliminary results and compare the efficacy of different survey methods at detecting herpetofauna at four TMD installations during the 2024 season.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
177,Effects of Vegetative Composition and Structure on Avian Presence and Diversity in the Rolling Plains,"Abstract: A large number of grassland-obligate bird species are considered Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), due to declining numbers and rarity. The declines can be attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation of native rangelands, largely due to brush encroachment or conversion to cropland/monocultures. In an effort to evaluate the effects of brush encroachment and vegetation diversity on grassland-obligate species in the Texas Rolling Plains, we deployed audio recording units (ARUs) on a property near Crowell, Texas. The ARUs are located in an unmanaged and ungrazed portion of the ranch, which has been greatly encroached by mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and juniper (Juniperus pinchotii). In the Rolling Plains, grassland-obligate bird species will utilize grasslands year-round, if adequate habitat and resources are available. However, brush encroachment may reduce presence of grassland-obligate birds. Prior to planned brush management activities (chemical treatment), the deployed ARUs will record presence and composition of grassland-obligate species at the site, or the lack thereof. This data will serve as our pre-management baseline. At each ARU location, habitat analysis will be conducted to enable evaluations of avian species presence and diversity relative to vegetative attributes. Throughout the brush management process, the ARUs will remain in place, enabling monitoring of changes in avian presence over time relative to alterations in brush density and the herbaceous community. We anticipate that avian presence and diversity will increase as a result of brush management.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
178,How Flight Behavior Responses of Eastern Fox Squirrels Differ Between Rural,"Abstract: The risk-allocation hypothesis states that a tradeoff exists between engaging in antipredator behaviors and foraging. Thus, flight decisions are often based on weighing the cost of remaining and the cost of fleeing. However, animals in urban settings are continually exposed to non-lethal, anthropogenic stimuli, resulting in behavioral plasticity and learning that reduces their antipredator responses in a process called habituation. In order to delineate the effects of habituation, direct observation was utilized to examine the flight behavioral responses of two distinct populations of Eastern fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) by quantifying alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID). AD is the distance at which an individual is aware of an approaching object, while FID is the distance at which an individual begins to flee. These metrics may be affected by ecological factors such as distance to cover, cover type, and canopy cover, as well as anthropogenic factors such as method of approach. To differentiate between these factors, four treatments, the approach of a single walker, a group, a cyclist, and a dog, were implemented at a rural site, encompassing three different ecoregions, and at an urban site during both winter and spring. Though still in the process of data collection, understanding a species’ habituation to humans and how it affects their behavior and life history strategy are important as human development continues to directly and indirectly affect wildlife. Understanding both the extent of human-wildlife interaction and the species-specific response becomes critical in the management and conservation of species.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
179,White-tailed Deer Population Size and Habitat Use in Urban Parks that Differ in Area and Habitat Structure,"Abstract: The urban areas are not typically built with wildlife in mind, but they do contain patches of natural habitats that are suitable for varieties of flora and fauna. For organisms, the city ecosystem provides a mosaic of highly patchy habitats that encompass stream corridors, transportation corridors, forest fragments in parks and residential neighborhoods, golf courses, traffic islands, patchy green spaces, and open recreational areas. In this ongoing research, we ask how these organisms survive and persist in landscapes where there is extreme variation in habitat heterogeneity in terms of habitat structure, shelter, and food resources. This ongoing research is aimed at gaining a better understanding of population size, habitat selection, and foraging behavior of a large mammal in urbanized ecosystems that differ in patch sizes and habitat structure. We have been evaluating white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) habitat use and foraging behavior in five Urban parks in Laredo City, TX, since August 2024. We used camera traps (22 in total) along with habitat structure measurements to document the deer habitat use and activity patterns and to quantify population characteristics. We will present our preliminary results on population sizes, deer habitat use, and foraging patterns in these parks. Understanding spatial and temporal habitat use of the fragmented urban landscapes will be an essential component in the creation of effective urban deer management programs in Laredo City.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
180,Evaluating Avian Community Response to Spatial Regime Shifts in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province,"Abstract: Regime shifts are characterized by a sudden, persistent change in ecosystem structure and function, which is difficult to reverse and can alter the provision of ecosystem services. In South Texas, the Tamaulipan Biotic Province has undergone abrupt changes, driven by land-use change, brush management, and introduction of invasive grasses. The Tamaulipan thornscrub has shifted into an alternative stable state, with reduced shrub diversity and a dense understory of invasive grasses. Native shrubland obligates, such as chestnut-bellied scaled quail (Callipepla squamata castanogastris; hereafter “scaled quail”), are vulnerable to these changes as they rely on thornscrub. We evaluated the impacts of spatial regime shifts on the distribution of scaled quail and the associated avian community across 19 counties in South Texas. Using data from the Rangeland Analysis Platform, we identified 3 disturbance categories: high, medium, and low indicative of state transitions within this region. Classifications were based on covariance values between woody and herbaceous cover, where negative covariance indicated greater disturbances. From May-July 2024, we conducted 1,010-point counts and recorded 111 species. Medium disturbance areas had the highest species richness (93 species), compared to high (85) and low (86). While alpha diversity was consistent across categories, beta diversity was greatest with medium disturbance (0.644), suggesting moderate disturbances may create vegetation conditions that support diverse avian communities. Scaled quail detection rates were notably low (0.02%), underscoring challenges in monitoring this species.

181,Nocturnal vs Diurnal Use of Riparian Areas by Feral Pigs in North-central Texas,"Abstract: Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are widespread invasive ecosystem engineers whose behavior can result in significant damage to valuable landscapes, such as riparian areas. Feral pig activity may vary daily and across seasons. Our study area is part of an on-going restoration site in Palo Pinto Mountains State Park that will soon open to the public. Understanding feral pig activity patterns could assist with future management of the riparian areas and the species. Our study investigated feral pig daily activity patterns by season in riparian areas in the Western Cross Timbers ecoregion in north- central Texas. We used 20 game cameras placed at 250 m intervals from January 2022 to July 2024 to monitor feral pig activity. We positioned each camera 51 cm above the ground and used 24 h motion detection with a 1 min delay. We obtained approximately 8,000 detections of feral pigs in our study area. We will use Timelapse 2.0 to analyze images, and overlap and kernel density packages in R statistical software, to examine daily activity patterns and how they change with seasons. We hope to increase our understanding of feral pig behavior to assist with future conservation initiatives for maintaining a balanced, healthy ecosystem within Palo Pinto Mountains State Park.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
182,"Arthropod Response to Grazing of Southern Plains Bison at Caprock Canyons State Park, Texas","Abstract: In 1997, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) relocated 36 Southern Plains bison (Bison bison bison) to Caprock Canyons State Park (6,070-ha) in Briscoe County, Texas. In 2011, TPWD released another 80 captive bison and present- day estimates are approximately 250 bison in the park. For management of the herd and the ecosystem, it is important to understand the impact, if any, bison have on vegetation and arthropods. Our objective was to determine how bison grazing impacts the diversity and abundance of arthropods. In summer 2018, TPWD established 18, 3x3-m2 grazing-exclusion plots. Monthly from September 2020 to August 2022, we surveyed vegetation and arthropods within each exclusion plot paired with an adjacent grazed plot 30-m away. At each grazed and non-grazed plot, we deployed one pitfall trap (0.27-L cup) and one bee bowl trap (0.53-L cup). We randomly selected the color of the bee-bowl trap (i.e., fluorescent yellow, white, or blue) because of arthropod color preferences. We baited both trap types with ethylene glycol and deployed traps for 24 hours. We identified arthropods to the ordinal level (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Araneae, and Other). Preliminary investigations of our data suggest that grouping at the order level likely masked interactions among arthropods, vegetation, and southern plains bison. For future studies, we propose identification of arthropods to lower taxonomic resolutions to improve identification of interactions. We hope to encourage additional metrics of biodiversity monitoring for arthropods at local scales to improve conservation efforts.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
183,Survival of the Generalist? A Comparison of Kitten Survival and Reproduction in Bobcats and Ocelots,"Abstract: Estimating reproductive rates is critical to understanding population dynamics. Where generalist and specialist species are sympatric, competition may limit access to resources. This may lead to temporal and/or spatial segregation of denning sites or timing of reproductive events. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are resource generalists and federally listed ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) are dense canopy specialists in the northern part of their range. Both species are similar-sized, sympatric felids that likely partition resources to maximize individual- and population-level fitness. Our proposed research will assess: (1) first-year survival of bobcats and ocelots in South Texas; (2) timing and frequency of reproductive events; and (3) contrasting bobcat and ocelot den site selection. Survival data will be collected from expandable VHF collars on kittens and analyzed in a known-fate Bayesian framework. Multivariate linear regression and resource selection functions will be used to assess what factors affect reproductive timing/frequency and den site selection, respectively. We predict that, in both species, (1) mother's age and previous experience will affect kitten survival; (2) time of year, monthly rainfall, and vegetation cover will impact reproductive timing and frequency; and (3) patch configuration, vegetation composition, and distance from roads will influence den establishment. We predict that bobcats will generally select den sites with less dense vertical cover compared to ocelots. Insights into reproduction of these two species will elucidate resource partitioning between two sympatric carnivores, and will ultimately inform models of population dynamics to guide ocelot recovery in the United States.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
184,Seasonal Abundance and Site Use of Three Waterfowl Species in North- central Texas,"Abstract: Numerous studies have been conducted to enhance land management strategies to support waterfowl populations; however, minimal research has focused on monitoring waterfowl migration patterns within the Cross Timbers ecoregion. Palo Pinto Mountains State Park is within the Cross Timbers ecoregion and hosts multiple bodies of water including stock tanks, intermittent rivers, and ephemeral streams that are used by various waterfowl during wintering. Our study aims to investigate how waterfowl species overlap in water resource use through seasonal activity patterns, abundance, and site use of stock tanks and streams within Palo Pinto Mountains State Park. We focus on three of the most observed ducks: American wigeon (Mareca americana), gadwall (m. strepera), and ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris). To address our aim, we will identify arrival and departure timing, fluctuations in species abundance across the season, and how the three species might be partitioning use of the area through preferences for sites or variations in activity. We placed 3 24-hr motion-activated, infrared game cameras at each of 2 stock tanks, and 10 cameras distributed at intervals 150–200 m apart along the stream in 2023 and 2024. Additionally, we conduct in- person waterfowl surveys twice a month from fall to spring 2022–2024. Implications of this study will further our understanding of seasonal and wintering habitat use and activity within a predominantly hardwood, riparian ecosystem in north-central Texas.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
185,Evaluating Efficacy of Pollinator Sampling Techniques for Comparison with Novel Molecular Methods: Preliminary Findings,"Abstract: Pollinators provide vital ecosystem services which are imperiled by increasing rates in pollinator decline. Efforts to effectively monitor pollinator health and diversity are becoming increasingly important factors in local conservation efforts. As part of a project testing the efficacy of a novel method of pollinator monitoring, which will use environmental DNA (eDNA) to determine presence and abundance of the rare variable cuckoo bumble bee (Bombus variabilis), and its host the American bumble bee (B. pensylvanicus), we are conducting traditional methods of monitoring across the state of Texas as a point of comparison. We will collect data throughout the growing seasons (spring to fall) 2024-2026 in sites that align with the historical distribution of the two species. We established 14 study clusters (150-km radius) comprising of state parks, natural areas, and wildlife management areas across Texas. In each cluster, we will run 30-m transects and sample vegetation and pollinators within 3 0.5 m2 quadrats every 10 m along the transects. We will sample plant species richness, height, and horizontal canopy cover within each quadrat. Additionally, we will sample pollinators along transects using an insect vacuum. We will combine our eDNA surveys with knowledge of flora from the transects to elucidate plant-pollinator interactions occurring across the state of Texas. This information will also provide insight into the integrity of ecosystem service across the state, as well as demonstrating the advantages and limitations of the novel eDNA to monitor for rare or cryptic pollinators in Texas.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
186,Microbiome and Virome of Ocelots in South Texas: Insights into Population Health,"Abstract: The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), an endangered mesocarnivore in South Texas, is limited to two relatively small and geographically disparate populations that are susceptible to stochastic events, including disease outbreaks. Understanding disease dynamics, including identifying pathogens of concern and factors that influence host susceptibility, is critical for conserving this species. Studying the microbiome (diversity of microorganisms) and virome (diversity of viruses) of ocelots can provide valuable insights into ocelot health and resilience against disease. The gastrointestinal microbiome plays a vital role in immunity, digestion, metabolism, and resistance to infections. Disruptions to the microbiome–which may be caused by stress, environmental changes, or pathogen exposure–can influence immune response and susceptibility to infection. The virome allows for the identification of viruses present in ocelot populations, whether harmful or benign. Describing the virome will allow for the identification of emerging diseases that could threaten ocelots, as well as other wildlife, domestic animals, and humans, in the region. We propose using next-generation sequencing of blood and semen samples to describe the gastrointestinal microbiome and virome of ocelots from South Texas rangelands related to host and demographic factors such as body condition, disease status, age and sex, and ecological factors such as density of other species in the habitat. Our findings will provide detailed knowledge of host-pathogen interactions in order to design effective management and conservation strategies for the prevention of infectious disease outbreaks.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
187,Genetic Evaluation of Texas Nilgai: Understanding Their Origins and Effects of Introduction,"Abstract: Nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus), commonly known as blue bull, are native to India. Nilgai were introduced to South Texas in the 1930s and now have a free-ranging population exceeding 30,000, forming a significant presence in the region. Despite their numbers and popularity as a game animal, little is known about their ecological role or genetic diversity, complicating effective management strategies. The primary goal of this study is to trace the geographic origins of the Texas nilgai population and understand how they were introduced. The study has three main objectives: (1) trace the population's origins, (2) assess genetic diversity to evaluate potential genetic bottlenecks and drift, and (3) examine genetic variation to assess disease risk. DNA samples were collected from hunter-harvested nilgai throughout South Texas, focusing on sequencing mtDNA cytochrome b and nuclear prion protein genes. Genetic diversity will be analyzed and compared to publicly available DNA sequence data to identify the origin of founding stocks and variations in the prion protein gene that may indicate susceptibility to prion diseases like chronic wasting disease. The study also raises awareness of the effects of introducing exotic species, even in small numbers, and how they can alter local ecosystems. Using the Texas nilgai as an example, the research highlights how such introductions can lead to rapid population growth, affecting local wildlife, agriculture, and biodiversity. Understanding their genetic diversity will guide more informed management strategies and contribute to broader discussions on non-native species' impacts.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
188,Examining Floral Rewards and Insects Pollinator Behavior in Reponse to Drought in North-central Texas,"Abstract: Global plant and insect diversity is in decline; climate change, urbanization, and habitat loss are among the factors contributing to this decline. In Texas, current climate projections suggest the arid line shifting eastward to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex by 2050, as well as increased frequency and severity of drought. Drought may have negative effects on the quality, quantity, and availability of floral rewards, influencing insect pollinators’ behavior; this encourages a need to incorporate drought- tolerant plants into urban and natural environments as a strategy to conserve insect pollinators. We seek to examine differences in floral rewards (nectar) and insect pollinator response to drought-tolerant plants under different water deficits as a simulation of drought. Our study will be a two-factorial garden experiment arranged in a randomized complete split-block design with irrigation (Factor 1) imposed as a split plot while plant species (Factor 2) are randomized within blocks (three replicates each) to account for soil differences. We will measure the response of floral rewards (nectar production, nectar volume, nectar concentration, and nectar sugar content), and insect pollinators’ abundance, richness, plant preference, and flower visitation throughout the growing season. Our study will provide essential information into sustainable practices for both urban and natural environments by identifying drought-tolerant plant species that provide floral rewards during periods of water-deficit, as well as retain insect pollinators and the essential ecosystem service they provide for North-Central Texas and the Southern Great Plains.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
189,Assessing Saprophagous Insect Community Response to Anthelmintics in Texas Grassland Ecosystems,"Abstract: Grassland ecosystems are experiencing declines in biodiversity at regional scales, prompting further study to refine local conservation and management. Saprophagous (decomposer) insects, particularly dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) play an essential role in grassland ecosystem health by aiding in nutrient cycling, bioturbation, improving soil quality, and secondary seed dispersal. Conversely, these saprophagous taxa are experiencing declines in density and biodiversity across grassland ecosystems; although many factors contribute to these declines, widespread use of anthelmintics such as Ivermectin in livestock management may have negative consequences for saprophagous populations and, by extension, ecosystem processes they provide. Our study investigates the effects of Ivermectin-treated dung on saprophagous insect abundance, diversity, and activity, with particular emphasis on dung beetles. We hypothesize that Ivermectin and other anthelmintic residues in dung will reduce saprophagous abundance and alpha diversity. We will survey saprophagous insects across managed grassland settings in Erath, Somervell, and Mills counties by establishing transects lined with pitfall traps baited with dung treated with and without anthelmintics. We will collect pitfall traps after 48 hours and measure saprophagous insect abundance and richness. Furthermore, we will conduct laboratory experiments using reared dung beetle colonies and expose dung beetles to treated and untreated dung in choice and no-choice testing to assess behavior, survival, and reproduction. We seek to provide insights into the potential unintended consequences of livestock treatments on non-target species, with recommendations for conservation practices that promote sustainable regenerative grassland practices.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
190,Experimental Approaches to Improve Survival and Conservation of Swift Fox (Vulpes velox),"Abstract: The swift fox (Vulpes velox) has been a species of conservation concern for the last 30 years across the entirety of its range. The species holds the status of S1 ‘Critically Imperiled’ in Texas where there is currently only one functional population remaining in Dallam County. As short-grass prairie specialists, swift foxes have suffered from a lack of suitable habitat as prairie is converted to cropland. Additionally, land management practices have resulted in increased vegetation height that facilitates increased predation risk from coyotes (Canis latrans), the primary cause of mortalities. We will be evaluating a novel approach to reduce coyote predation on swift foxes by deploying livestock guardian dogs (hereafter LGDs) with grazing cattle (Bos taurus) within known swift fox areas. LGDs have been used to reduce predation on livestock and recent research has demonstrated that LGDs do not negatively influence foxes. We will capture and attach GPS collars to swift foxes and coyotes in the Rita Blanca National Grasslands in the first year of the study to obtain pre-treatment spatial data. From the second year onwards, we will repeat this process and add LGDs to the landscape. We will compare pre- and post-treatment space use and changes in swift fox survival.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
191,Habitat Preferences of Northern Bobwhite and Scaled Quail: Unraveling Nesting Site Selection in Conservation Reserve Program and Pasture Lands,"Abstract: We investigated the nesting preferences of Northern Bobwhite Quail (Colinus virginianus) and Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata) in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) areas and Pastures across a 4,800-acre study area, where CRPs constituted 11% (527.2 acres) and Pastures 89% (4,272.8 acres) of the total landscape. The null hypothesis was that quail do not exhibit a preference for nesting in CRPs versus Pastures, and this was tested using a Chi-Square analysis to compare observed and expected bird distributions. Results indicated a significant difference in nesting distribution (χ² = 10.21, p = 0.0014), leading us to reject the null hypothesis. Adjusting for the proportional area of CRPs and Pastures, the expected counts were recalculated based on the proportional availability of each habitat. Bobs were overrepresented in CRPs and underrepresented in Pastures, whereas Blues were underrepresented in CRPs and overrepresented in Pastures. These findings suggest that habitat preferences of quail were not solely driven by the proportional area available. Bobs exhibited a preference for nesting in CRPs despite the larger area of Pastures, whereas Blues showed a strong preference for Pastures. The results highlight the role of factors beyond area size, such as habitat quality, in determining nesting site selection. These insights have important implications for wildlife habitat management, suggesting that conservation strategies should consider the specific habitat preferences of different species, rather than solely focusing on habitat availability.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
192,Habitat Use and Movement of Collared Peccaries Associated with the U.S.- Mexico Border Barrier System,"Abstract: The construction of border barrier systems along international boundaries may have ecological impacts on wildlife populations and their habitats. Research on species such as jaguars (Panthera onca) and ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) indicate that border barriers can restrict movement and connectivity. However, limited empirical data exist on the effects of linear barriers on mid-sized ungulates like the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu). These barriers may alter collared peccary movement and habitat selection, potentially affecting survival and connectivity. To address this knowledge gap, we will determine the effects of the United States-Mexico border barrier system on collared peccary movement patterns, home range characteristics, and habitat selection. Collared peccaries were captured at sites close to the barrier, and two individuals per squadron were fitted with GPS collars. Using GPS data, we will assess direct impacts, such as habitat loss and fragmentation caused by the physical barrier, and indirect effects that may be related to noise, artificial lighting, and human activity. Findings from this study will contribute to the growing knowledge of how large-scale infrastructure affects wildlife and transboundary connectivity. By quantifying these ecological effects, the research will offer insights into balancing infrastructure development with biodiversity conservation. Finally, results will be spatially explicit, enabling conservation practitioners and policymakers to identify and prioritize mitigation measures to reduce potential impacts on wildlife.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
193,Monitoring Biodiversity of Pollinating Insects Along North-Central Texas Roadway,"Abstract: Monitoring Biodiversity of Pollinating Insects Along North-Central Texas Roadways. Multiple factors contribute to pollinator decline, loss of floral resources through land conversion, particularly urbanization. Where roadsides are argued as suitable habitat for pollinators. However, roadsides may also reduce pollinator diversity through low-quality floral resources, introduction of invasive flora, and reduced mortality by vehicles. Our study focused on assessing roadsides for pollinator biodiversity in North-Central Texas. We surveyed 58.1 km of U.S. Route 377 within the Erath Co., between 2020-2022. We sampled vegetation and pollinators at 1 km intervals on the side of the road every two weeks starting the second week of February and ending the second week of May, for a total of 464 points over eight collecting periods each year. We sampled between 08:00-10:30 or between temperatures of 12.8-32.2°C. Within each sampling point, we would survey vegetation along a 10-m transect and measure plant density and species richness. We sampled pollinators along the same transect with a modified leaf-vacuum for 30 seconds. We seek to record the presence, species and composition of native pollinator communities at varying traffic densities to determine changes in native pollinator diversity over time to improve conservation strategies in pollinator health under increasing urbanization in North-Central Texas",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
194,Flight Distance and Preferred Cover of Northern Bobwhite Quail and Scaled Quail,"Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) and scaled quail (Callipepla squamata), focusing on their flight distances and cover preferences after being flushed by a researcher. Specifically, I hypothesize that bobwhite quail will exhibit longer flight distances than scaled quail, and that both species will prefer woody cover types over grassy cover types. Data was collected by flushing radio-collared birds and marking landing sites. Straight-line flight distances were calculated using OnX. Preliminary results from 28 flushes (14 per species) revealed no significant difference in flight distances between bobwhite (avg. 79 m) and scaled quail (avg. 99 m) (p = 0.103), supporting the null hypothesis. In terms of cover preference, bobwhite quail sought shelter in woody cover 11 of 14 times, while scaled quail did so 12 of 14 times, showing a stronger preference for woody cover than available in the environment. Bobwhite quail most commonly selected prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) (3 of 14 flushes), while scaled quail preferred honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) (3 of 14 flushes). These findings offer valuable insights for wildlife management. Understanding flight distances can inform habitat planning, such as determining appropriate woody shrub densities for quail habitats. Additionally, knowledge of cover preferences can guide the selection of plant species to manage for, helping reduce predation risks and promoting quail population growth by ensuring access to suitable cover types.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
195,Evaluating Rates of Fire Spread in Various Grass Species for Safer Texas Roadways,"Abstract: The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is mandated by the Clean Water Act to seed areas disturbed by construction activities. In an effort to be good neighbors and environmental stewards, TxDOT has made a commitment to use native grasses that will become established quickly along highways and roadsides at the completion of road construction. These grasses are important for protecting newly- constructed roadsides by holding the soil in place, particularly during rain events. Unfortunately, wildfires commonly start along roads or highways as people discard cigarettes, or pull over to the side in a disabled vehicle, etc. Our project is investigating the rates of fire spread through several grass species that TxDOT currently uses, including silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), southwestern bristlegrass (Setaria scheelei), spike lovegrass (Eragrostis spicata), whiplash pappusgrass (Pappophorum vaginatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). We are burning 0.10-acre monoculture plots of various grass species with HOBO dataloggers placed at 5-m intervals throughout the plot to record fire temperature and rates of spread. Our results will help TxDOT choose species that may slow the spread of unintended fires, helping firefighters control roadside wildfires more quickly and keep drivers safe from smoke-related accidents.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
196,Quantifying the Spatial Distribution of Macartney Rose Using Very Fine-scale Imagery,"Abstract: Invasive plants can rapidly dominate a landscape and homogenize plant communities by displacing native species. One invasive species affecting Southeast Texas rangelands is Macartney Rose (Rosa bracteata J.C. Wendl.). There is an increasing need for controlling this species to increase space and resources for ranching operations. It is essential to quantify the extent of an invasion when implementing control techniques. Drone imagery enables efficient data collection by increasing sampling coverage and reducing labor requirements. The objective of this study is to quantify the spatial distribution of Macartney rose using an image classification applied to high-resolution imagery on a cattle ranch in Northwest Harris County, Texas. We applied a supervised image classification technique to 1.3 cm resolution RGB drone imagery to separate Macartney rose individuals from other vegetation and land cover types. Ground-verification points of the cover type present are used to assess the accuracy of the classification. The class and patch level data from the classifications is used to compute metrics that quantify the distribution of the Macartney rose. We expect to achieve an overall accuracy greater than 75%, and a Macartney rose classification accuracy greater than 85% towards generating accurate estimates of the spatial extent of Macartney rose invasion at our study area. We also expect to see differences in patch metrics for Macartney rose across the pasture due to variation in cover concentrations. These results offer methods for quantifying invasive woody species which can improve our ability to implement control techniques, monitor stands, and understand species behavior.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
197,Evaluating Field-based Learning and its Role on the Expressions of Self- identified Wildlife Value Orientation During a Natural Resource Management Degree Curriculum,"Abstract: Education, specifically applied and experiential learning, has been proven to contribute to the adoption of pro-environmental behaviors. However, limited research evaluates the connection between applied learning and its impact on the expression of wildlife value orientations (WVOs). WVOs have been used to predict people’s attitudes and behaviors in relation to environmental management and perceived environmental impacts. The Cognitive Hierarchy Theory reveals that values and value orientations are expressed extensively through attitudes and behavioral intentions. Knowing this, this study aims to explore the role of an applied and experiential learning focused curriculum in promoting pro-environmental attitudes, behavioral intentions, and ultimately, expressions of self-identified WVOs among recent college graduates and college students nearing graduation. It further aims to identify teaching methodologies that contributed to a self-identified change in expression across WVOs. To achieve this goal, data will be collected from recent graduates of the Texas A&M University Department of Rangeland, Wildlife, and Fisheries Management (RWFM) and its senior seminar course. Participants will complete a three part quantitative survey by rating statements on a Likert scale, recalling how they felt before enrolling in RWFM, and how they feel upon the program’s completion. Consenting participants will expand upon their responses in a follow-up qualitative interview, which will allow for participants to identify in-depth the reasoning behind self-identified changes. We hypothesize that students will identify experiential learning and applied activities as the most influential in developing pro- environmental attitudes, and shifts in behavioral intentions and expressions of self- identified WVOs.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
198,An Experimental Test of Delayed Plumage Maturation Hypothesis in Painted Buntings,"Abstract: Painted Buntings, Passerina ciris, display delayed plumage maturation, wherein young males retain green plumage, almost identical in appearance to the plumage of juveniles and females, despite being capable of reproduction. The primary driver of delayed plumage maturation is unknown, though previously believed to be the result of a molt constraint. To experimentally test hypotheses related to delayed plumage maturation, we first captured adult and juvenal males using mist nets. These males were color-banded for individual identification. Experimental males were then temporarily put in a cage and placed within an established, adult male’s territory. We used playback to call in focal males, and quantified the aggression of the focal male to the caged, experimental male during a 10-minute observation period. We tallied the number of songs, calls, approaches, wing quivers and “attacks” of the responding male. Attacks were defined as a territorial male landing on or flying within 0.5 m of the simulated intruder cage. We found territorial males were significantly more likely to attack adult males than juvenal males, as no juvenal males were attacked in trials (p= 0.007, n=23). Interestingly, the rate of singing for focal males did not vary by age class. Additionally, these experiments yielded interesting anecdotal results, with territorial males occasionally displaying towards juvenal males as if they were females. A future study is planned to implement trials comparing the response of territorial males to the simulation of intruding females and young males.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
199,Cackling Geese Selection of Roost Sites during the Non-Breeding Period,"Abstract: The selection of roost sites is of great ecological importance during the non- breeding period of waterfowl. Roost sites provide safety from predators and are within energetically appropriate distance from forage. The Cackling goose (Branta hutchinsii) is gregarious during the nonbreeding period, roosting in large flocks in open water bodies at night and traveling to surrounding land during the day to feed. The primary objective of this study is to determine roost site selection and the environmental factors that drive roost site choice. We deployed GPS telemetry collars on female cackling geese wintering in the southern Great Plains region (Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas) of the USA. After nocturnal locations of geese are used to determine roost sites, we will measure the longest distance traveled to foraging sites by each individual. We will use the longest average distance across individuals as a radius to delineate landscapes around roost sites and extract biologically meaningful landscape metrics using Fragstats. We will randomly identify 50 wetlands of similar type within each state and apply the radius to delineate same-sized landscapes. Using logistic regression, we will compare metrics between random and used landscapes to understand drivers of selection. By understanding the environmental factors which drive roost site selection, this research will help identify priority areas for nonbreeding habitat management of cackling geese wintering in the southern Great Plains.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
200,Mule Deer in the Trans-Pecos: How Habitat Selection Affects Survivability and the Effectiveness of Brush Management in Improving Mule Deer Habitat,"Abstract: Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are a species of management concern in Texas because of their economic importance, and declining populations. While many factors may contribute to population declines, brush encroachment degrades mule deer habitat quality throughout their range. I will study the influences of brush encroachment on habitat selection within a population of mule deer in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas and the consequences of that selection for individual survival. From 2015 to 2019, 144 mule deer were translocated to Black Gap Wildlife Management Area (BGWMA), with 67 animals fitted with GPS collars, and a capture at BGWMA in 2023, with 29 animals fitted with GPS collars. I will be using Integrated Step Selection Analysis (iSSA) as the framework to analyze the GPS data, incorporating elevation, slope, TPI (topographic position index), and TRI (terrain ruggedness index), derived from a 30-m digital elevation model, and brush density. To estimate brush density, I will use a novel approach combining field vegetation data, rasters of the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), and Functional Principal Component Analysis (fPCA) to relate vegetation dynamics to brush canopy cover. I hypothesize mule deer will select for low to intermediate levels of brush cover and that deer selecting for sub-optimal levels of brush cover will experience greater mortality. If so, higher populations of mule deer could be maintained with lower brush density and adequate plant species composition. This framework could then be used to monitor mule deer habitat quality via satellite, facilitating mule deer habitat improvements.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
201,Transboundary Occupancy of the American Black Bears: Implications for Metapopulation Dynamics between the US and Mexico,"Abstract: An increase in border infrastructure in Texas, and elsewhere in the world, has been documented to increase habitat fragmentation, decrease population connectivity, and gene flow in transboundary wildlife populations, especially affecting large ranging carnivore species. Since the first resident population of the American black bear (Ursus americanus) returned to Big Bend National Park, Texas in 1988, their range has slowly expanded over the last four decades. This has coincided with an increase in border infrastructure development along the US-Mexico border. Of the 254 counties in Texas, 36 counties have had credible black bear sightings, six of which being noted as having established breeding populations. The bears in these six southwest Texas counties, are a part of the greater Southwest (Southwest Texas and Northern Mexico) black bear metapopulation and are supplemented by bears moving northward through the Chihuahuan desert and sky island archipelago landscape across the Texas-Mexico border. Estimating black bear occupancy will inform metapopulation dynamics and will help managers prioritize movement corridors for long term population sustainability. We will deploy 50 trail cameras in a randomized camera occupancy grid design, buffered at 4, 8, and 12km distances from the Rio Grande River, across Val Verde, Kinney, and Maverick counties. Each randomly selected grid, evenly split between all buffers, will host a camera to estimate current black bear occupancy and identify potential corridors of transboundary movement that might be affected by current and future border infrastructure and activity.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
202,An Introduction to Environmental Consulting,"Abstract: Gather insight into the world of environmental consulting and the opportunities available in the field. Environmental consultants work with a variety of developers and government agencies to help them understand potential impacts and level of impacts to wildlife species. Some of the key responsibilities they undertake include wildlife research and monitoring, environmental permitting, statistics and biometrics, technology, vegetation & reclamation, and wetlands and water. Consulting for renewable energy such as wind and solar developments can include initial resource evaluation, analysis of environmental issues, permitting and construction planning, and operation and post-construction monitoring. Knowledge of laws, regulations, and guidelines for developments all play a role in successful wildlife consulting. Permits often require studies that must begin well before permit applications are submitted. Knowledge and skills as biologists, mammologists, and ecologists can be utilized to help developers to minimize and mitigate potential impacts to species. To understand what species may be impacted by a proposed project, consultants use a variety of tools including government websites, state agency sites, natural history databases, books and field guides, citizen-science databases, spatial databases and more. The field of wildlife consulting holds a variety of potential career paths including wildlife biologist, GIS specialist, species expert, and statistician. Developing your skills and gaining experience through field work, writing, joining working groups, volunteering, and contributing to citizen science are some of the steps that can lead to a job in consulting .",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
203,Determining Optimal Segmentation Parameters for Object-based Classification of Woody Species Using Fine-scale Resolution,"Abstract: Macartney rose (Rosa bracteata J.C. Wendl.) is an invasive evergreen woody species that poses a significant threat to the biodiversity of Texas rangelands. Remote sensing technology, including drones and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), offers a unique approach in detecting this species. Segmentation is a novel approach to supervised classification of land cover. Image segmentation groups neighboring pixels that share similar characteristics in shape, texture, and color. However, there is very little information on how to use segmentation to classify Macartney rose. We have observed a high degree of variance in previous studies for spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and the minimum segment size. Therefore, our objective is to select different segmentation sizes to optimize classification of Macartney rose with two remote sensing platforms: Drone-acquired and NAIP imagery. To achieve this goal, we classified Macartney Rose into groups depending on the number of pixels within a motte. Mottes that are <5 m2 in area are classified as small, >5-20 m2 are classified as medium, and >20 m2 are classified as large. These mottes are then classified using a range of segmentation settings. Once classified, accuracy assessments were conducted using a confusion matrix. These results will improve the methodologies for segmentation by providing a range of settings according to the size of the patches to be identified and improve overall classification of patches of Macartney rose in pastures affected by this invasive species. With improved vegetation monitoring techniques, we can more effectively address habitat concerns.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
204,Differences in Ambient vs Internal Trap Temperatures: Implications for Safe Protocol for Trapping Black Bears in West Texas,"Abstract: In recent years, black bears (Ursus americanus) have begun recolonizing their historical ranges in West Texas by migrating north from Mexico. To better understand their population dynamics, ecological behavior, and how best to manage them in the future, information gathered at capture events will be invaluable. However, there are many animal safety concerns when trapping and handling wildlife, particularly in harsh environments, such as arid West Texas. With little shade and high daytime temperatures hyperthermia is a serious risk during the capture process. To mitigate this risk, careful consideration of ambient temperatures during trapping is critical to prevent physiological harm. We examined the ambient and internal temperature of four trap types at 10-minute intervals using I-button temperature loggers during the summer of 2024 with the goal of assessing how internal temperature differs given trap type. A significant difference between internal and ambient temperatures could necessitate adjustments to trapping and handling protocols. We used a generalized linear model to examine the influence of ambient temperature, trap material, trap volume, and trap material interacting with ambient temperature on internal trap temperature. We found an influence of trap type on internal temperature, with aluminum traps exhibiting lower internal temperatures than steel. Ambient temperature had a positive effect (β=0.86, SE =0.002, p<0.001), and trap volume had a negative effect (β=-0.68, SE =0.03, p<0.001) on internal temperature. The findings from this study are crucial for refining trapping methods and ensuring effective long-term management of black bears in west Texas.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
205,An Assessment of Heavy Metal Concentrations in South Texas Raptors,"Abstract: Heavy metals, such as lead, have become pervasive environmental toxicants, affecting both human and wildlife health globally. As predators and scavengers, raptors are particularly susceptible to accumulating heavy metals from the environment through their prey to the detriment of both individuals and populations. Given their ecological role and sensitivity to anthropogenic pollutants, raptors can serve as sentinels of environmental contamination. From 2022-2023, we collected blood, heart, and liver samples from black vultures (Coragyps atratus; n = 36) to assess heavy metal contamination in South Texas. Zinc had the highest accumulation across the liver and heart samples with averages of 24.1 μg/g wet weight and 21.67 μg/g wet weight, respectively. We did not detect significant amounts of thallium but did detect arsenic and cadmium accumulation in both the liver and heart. Lead accumulation was observed in the blood (0.07-2.17 μg/mL), liver (0.06-8.16 μg/g wwt), and heart (0.04- 0.81 μg/g wwt). Building on this work, we aim to understand the presence and extent of heavy metal exposure in other raptor species in South Texas that have foraging strategies beyond scavenging. Sampling will focus on red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), Swainson’s hawks (Buteo swainsoni), and Harris’s hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus). Results will be compared to the existing vulture data, providing insights into the vulnerability of different raptor species based on their diet and foraging strategies. These findings are essential for understanding the broader ecological effects of heavy metal pollution and guiding conservation efforts.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
206,South Texas Bobcat Interactions with Wildlife Crossings Structures and Other Wildlife,"Abstract: The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a common cat in the United States, native to southern Canada to southern Mexico. Bobcat populations have fluctuated over time. This has been associated with hunting, agricultural broadening, and habitat fragmentation. Roads are a major source of fragmentation and have wide ranging impacts on wildlife, including bobcats. Researchers at Texas A&M University - Kingsville have monitored five wildlife crossings on Farm-to-Market 1847 in Cameron County, Texas. For this study, we will assess how bobcat interactions at crossings are affected by intraguild competition, prey detections, and seasons. To do this, we collected data for two years after construction of the crossings and used a grading system to distinguish the different types of interactions with each crossing site. We predict that bobcat and canid interactions at crossings are inversely related, where the detection of bobcats increases when there is a decrease in coyote detections. The changes associated with monthly usage, for bobcats and coyotes, were thought to be used more during the winter months and during the spring months due to darker days and seeking shelter. The prey detections will likely increase during spring and summer months due to the increase in vegetation and the desire for warmer climates. Lastly, we expect a higher prey species abundance will reveal an increase in bobcat density per location. Our study would provide information on fluctuations of bobcat wildlife crossing usage depending on surrounding food sources, competitors, and potentially, seasons.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
207,"Fire, Forage, and Facilitation: Interspecies Interactions of Native and Exotic Ungulates in Managed Rangelands","Abstract: Exotic ungulates, like nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), are increasingly common on South Texas rangelands, forming novel assemblages of large herbivores. Initially introduced to enhance hunting opportunities and diversify ranch income, exotic ungulates have created new ecological dynamics that may alter vegetation and habitat use by native species like white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Understanding the impact of exotics on rangelands and native wildlife is essential for sustainable rangeland management. We deployed a systematic grid of camera traps on a 3,500-hectare ranch near Hebbronville, Texas, with approximately 10 exotic ungulate species alongside native species, such as white- tailed deer, to monitor spatial and temporal habitat use patterns and interspecies interactions following prescribed fire. Prescribed fire is typically used to alter forage availability and vegetation structure, which may influence ungulate activity and competition. In February 2022, 79 hectares were burned in 4 distinct units within our study area. Cameras were deployed immediately following the prescribed fire, collecting images every 10 minutes during the day and as triggered at night. Animal activity in burned and unburned units has been monitored for the last ~2.5 years following prescribed fire treatments, with over 230,000 images collected so far. We are leveraging these data to explore how native and exotic ungulates interact, focusing on temporal partitioning through diel activity patterns, shifts in habitat use over time since fire, and resource partitioning reflected in their spatial distribution. Insights from this study will guide mixed-species grazing management and help mitigate potential competition between native and exotic ungulates.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
208,"The Effect of Landscape and Human Infrastructure on Mammal Occupancy in the Jaguar´s Protection Corridor, Guaviare, Colombia","Abstract: The Jaguar Protection Corridor in Guaviare, Colombia, is a process of community conservation and reconciliation of livelihoods with nature. As part of this process, we seek to identify the effect of the landscape and human infrastructure on the populations of jaguars and other mammals that inhabit the corridor area. The corridor management area (496,000 ha) is located along the Guaviare River in the departments of Guaviare and Meta, Colombia. To identify how variables and at what spatial scale affect mammal species in the corridor, we used four camera trap surveys conducted between 2021 and 2024. The camera trap data were fitted to multi-species occupancy models using the following variables: forest patch size, fragmentation index, distance to human areas, road types, and access to water. Of the 36 species analyzed, 20 were affected by the selected variables. Both jaguar and prey occupancy were related to greater forest size and lower fragmentation index. Variables associated with human infrastructure did not have a strong effect on jaguar occupancy. However, the jaguar did show higher occupancy in flood zones. Our results provide a detailed view of the species-specific response to landscape characteristics and possible human disturbances. This allows us to identify priority areas to recover the ecological connectivity and to take appropriate management measures to ensure the permanence of the jaguar in the corridor, as well as that of the associated mammal community.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
209,Predicting Habitat for Bumble Bees in Texas Based on Floral Availability and Seasonality,"Abstract: Pollinating insects are declining across the globe; however, the magnitude of this decline varies across taxa, space, and time, requiring improved strategies to monitor pollinators at local scales. We seek to evaluate the availability of floral resources that would support populations of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) across the state of Texas. This project is part of a larger study assessing the distribution and conservation status of American bumble bee (B. pensylvanicus) and variable cuckoo bumble bee (B. variabilis) in Texas. In summer and fall 2024, we surveyed vegetation in state parks and wildlife management areas across multiple ecoregions in Texas and recorded species richness, horizontal canopy cover, and plant height for each species. We also used community aggregate databases (e.g., iNaturalist) and county checklists to identify distribution and blooming periods of plant species reported to serve as floral hosts for bumble bees in Texas. We will develop predictor models to identify landscapes with the greatest likelihood of bumble bee occupancy based on host plant density and distributions within and across seasons. We hope that these predictor models will help refine current management strategies to survey rare and cryptic bumble bees within Texas ecoregions.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
210,Determining Nesting Effort by Female Northern Pintails Remotely,"Abstract: The northern pintail (Anas acuta) is a species of concern and has remained below population objectives over the last 30 years. Part of the reason the population has declined is thought to be due to low nesting success from changes in farming practices within their breeding range, and increased rates of nest failure due to depredation. Our goal was to describe nesting behavior of northern pintails to understand nesting effort. We deployed 535 GPS/GSM-ACC tracking devices on female northern pintails across their wintering range in the southern U.S. (2019-2023). This allowed us to sample pintails settling on their breeding areas in the Prairie Pothole Region of the Great Plains, in the Boreal Region to the north, and in Alaska. Tracking devices were programmed to record a location (18-m accuracy) every hour, and a 3- second burst of accelerometer data every 15 minutes. We identified potential nest locations by considering fixes in terrestrial land-cover types (pintails spend the majority of time in wetlands but nest on land), where device speed was < 5 m/s, and that showed > 2 return visits. Nesting activity was investigated using the accelerometer data to identify incubating and active periods. A successful nest was identified when incubation behavior lasted > 22 days. Understanding nesting behavior of the northern pintail across its broad breeding range will provide new insights into their nesting ecology. This will also allow us to link reproductive success to temporal and spatial factors within their breeding distribution.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
211,Spatial Ecology in a Fragmented Landscape: How Roads Impact Ocelot and Bobcat Movement and Connectivity,"Abstract: The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) has become a conservation priority in southern Texas due to significant habitat loss and population decline during the 20th century. As a key component of the thornscrub ecosystem, ocelots help control local small mammal and bird populations. Only two known small populations of ocelots remain in the U.S., and these populations face primary threats from habitat loss and genetic inbreeding within fragmented populations. Currently, there is no evidence of connectivity between these populations, with roads serving as the leading source of mortality. Ocelot recovery will depend on improving habitat connectivity and establishing safe passages to facilitate movement between thornscrub habitats. Bobcats (Lynx rufus), which share similar life-history traits to ocelots, offer insights into the effects of road crossings and inform potential mitigation efforts. This study uses long-term GPS telemetry data for both bobcats and ocelots to analyze fine-scale movement patterns, with a focus on how roads influence movement decisions. I will apply resource selection functions under a step-selection function framework to identify movement patterns across a fragmented landscape. Additionally, I will identify road crossing sites and integrate roadkill data, landscape features, and highway variables to investigate factors influencing crossing behavior and mortality risk. Dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models will be used to assess animal movement and predict crossing probabilities while accounting for spatial and temporal variability. This study will contribute to conservation strategies aimed at enhancing landscape connectivity, reducing mortality risks, and informing road management policies to support ocelot recovery and long-term population sustainability.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
212,Presence of Microplastics in Arthropods Ingested by House Sparrows,"Abstract: Plastic pollution has increased at astounding rates across the globe and plastic waste and debris can potentially degrade into smaller pieces called microplastics (MPs). MPs have been detected in many bird species, but contamination routes remain poorly understood. One possibility could be trophic transfer. Through previous research, we found that nestlings in a house sparrow (Passer domesticus) colony in Stephenville, Texas contain MPs. Our objective was to determine if arthropods foraged by adult sparrows for feeding nestlings were a potential source for MP transfer to nestlings. In 2024, we collected arthropods using a sweep-netting method along a 10-m transect from 5 locations at our study site where we observed adult sparrows foraging. We recorded nest boxes on days 5-7 post-hatch, using video cameras placed on tripods approximately 2 m from the nest for 4 h, between 0630-1130, to identify food items delivered by parents. We identified all arthropods collected in the field and those we observed on the video cameras to taxonomic family. We analyzed arthropod samples using a chemical digestion of 30% H₂O₂ and identified MPs using Motic Panthera C2 trinocular compound microscope, with 4k digital video camera. We analyzed the percentage of contaminated individuals by family, MP/individual arthropod, and MP/gram of organic matter. Preliminary results show that approximately 37.5% (n = 17) of arthropods sampled contained MPs. The study will allow for further understanding of the presence of MPs in terrestrial environments and the potential for trophic transfer to songbirds.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
213,Environmental Degradation of Ivermectin in Deer Fecal Pellets and Comparison of Blood and Fecal Concentrations of Ivermectin,"Abstract: Tick-borne diseases have increased in incidence and expanded geographically in recent decades due to multiple factors including land-use changes, suburban development, and climate shifts. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; WTD) and other wildlife species are natural hosts for ticks, however options for the treatment of wildlife for tick infestations are limited. One proven method is the delivery of ivermectin via oral baiting stations. To be effective, adequate amounts of ivermectin must be delivered to each animal. Here, we explored the utility of using non-invasive fecal sampling as a method to determine ivermectin consumption and thus level of treatment. This study aimed to: (1) evaluate the correlation between ivermectin concentrations in plasma and feces after subcutaneous injection, and (2) determine the environmental degradation rate of ivermectin in WTD feces. Ivermectin was administered subcutaneously to WTD (n = 11; 200µg/kg). Paired blood and fecal samples were collected at days 3, 7, 14, and 21 post-injection. Fecal pellets were also collected at peak serum levels (3-days post-injection) and exposed to environmental conditions for degradation analysis over time. Ivermectin concentrations in feces were significantly higher than in plasma (p < 0.001) and strongly correlated with plasma (R2 = 0.7726, F(1,53) = 180.1, p = <0.0001). In the environment, ivermectin concentrations in fecal samples degraded linearly with time, however, levels were still > 1000 ppb after 30 days of environmental exposure. These findings highlight the potential of fecal analysis as a non-invasive quality control measure to ensure effective dosing through ivermectin- treated bait, supporting integrated tick management strategies.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
214,Dung Beetle Diversity in Grazing Regimes of Desert Grasslands,"Abstract: Dung beetles (family Scarabaeidae) are keystone species and are ecological assessors of rangelands. Dung beetles decompose feces by actively breaking down dung pats by burying and processing dung through tunneling underground. Ultimately, incorporating nutrients into the soil, a crucial process for nutrient cycling in ecosystems. These invertebrates are significant to livestock operations as their coexistence with grazing ruminant's is necessary to improve the overall health of grassland ecosystems. This study took place at the Mimms Ranch Unit of the Dixon Water Foundation, a 6,474.97 hectare property nestled in the Marfa Grasslands of Far West Texas. The ranch has rotational grazing regimes, with a control continuous grazing pasture. Allowing for the opportunity to compare the response of dung beetles to different grazing systems. Therefore, this study examines the presence and diversity of dung beetles between the different grazing systems. Beetles were collected in 120 randomized pitfall traps across two different soil types within each of the two grazing systems. We used an Analysis of Variance to see if there was a difference in amount of Bettles between treatments (P > 0.05). Results suggest there is a difference between treatments with rotational regime having a higher number of dung beetles. While the data collected from this study shows there is a difference in response of beetles, further research is needed to correlate the relationship between grazing systems, vegetation, and dung beetles properly.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
215,"A Standardized Comparison of Camera Trap Efficacy Across Price Points and Behavioral States Using a Novel Model ""Species""","Abstract: Remote photography, or camera trapping, is an increasingly popular tool for studying wildlife because it is often less time-consuming, invasive, and costly than alternative methods, particularly for large, elusive, or difficult-to-capture species. As the popularity of camera trapping has grown, so has the variety of camera traps available to consumers. These range from professional-grade traps with high resolution and detection capabilities to cameras designed for recreational use. Given the multitude of cameras on the market with varying price points and quality, selecting the appropriate model for a specific objective can be challenging. While numerous studies have compared camera traps in field settings, we are aware of no studies that have evaluated camera efficacy at standardized distances using a single aposematic organism across behavioral states. To address this gap, we used a member of the University of North Texas Student Chapter of The Wildlife Society outfitted in a large, anthropomorphic Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) costume to assess the efficacy of five camera traps varying in price and specifications at a restored Blackland Prairie in Denton County, Texas. Detection probabilities of each camera ($20–$750) were measured at 10%, 30%, 60%, and 100% of the maximum focal distance of the camera trap with the longest range, across three distinct gaits. We present these detection probabilities alongside a cost-benefit analysis considering detection consistency and price and provide practical recommendations for landowners and wildlife professionals.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
216,"Distribution of High-Elevation Owls in the Davis Mountains, Texas","Abstract: Several mountain ranges within the Chihuahuan Desert receive more precipitation and experience cooler temperatures than the surrounding lowland desert. This “sky island” effect allows for more diverse ecosystems within the mountain range, including canyon watersheds and pine forests, which support high-elevation bird species uncommon to the area. Due to the rugged and remote nature of the Chihuahuan Desert mountains, the distribution and occurrence of high-elevation species is poorly understood, especially for nocturnal birds. This study aims to evaluate the occurrence of nocturnal bird species in the Davis Mountains, particularly flammulated (Psiloscops flammeolus), northern saw-whet (Aegolius acadicus), and Mexican spotted (Strix occidentalis lucida) owls. Data collection will occur at the Davis Mountains Preserve between March and August, which spans the breeding seasons of the target species, when calls are more frequent. Data collection began in 2024 and will continue through 2025. Owls will be surveyed using autonomous recording units (ARUs). ARUs will be placed in locations where owls are expected to be, based on previous placement, terrain, and vegetation. There are 25 ARUs total, which will be set to record during peak call times (2-3 hours after sunset and before sunrise). Preliminary results show detections of all 3 target species at the Davis Mountains Preserve. Following analysis, ARU recording times and placement can be honed further based on frequency of owl calls and species/habitat associations.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
217,Total Inventory and Genomic Monitoring to Inform Ocelot-Transportation Ecology and Conservation Decision-making,"Abstract: Highways and other transportation facilities can act as effective barriers to the movement and dispersal of organisms, reducing the exchange of individuals between roadside populations, and possibly causing genetic subdivision. In addition, transportation facilities can lead to strikingly high numbers of road fatalities. In both cases, these barriers can reduce gene flow, accelerate the loss of genetic variation, increase inbreeding changes, and potentially lead to deleterious effects on a species’ population, such as population decline or local extinction. The above process is exacerbated in species of conservation concern. Thus, maintaining biological connectivity in the presence of transportation facilities, such as wildlife crossings, is required to inform about ocelot transportation ecology and therefore conservation decision-making. Recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics have revolutionized the ability to identify and monitor distinct individuals of a species, predict the origin of a given population, and map possible movement pathways of individuals. In addition, effectively characterizing genetic connectivity across the landscape will assist in properly locating, designing, and monitoring cost-effective wildlife crossings as well as develop other mitigation measures. Using a morphological (spot patterns) and genomics (next-generation sequencing) combinatorial approach, we will identify and monitor individual ocelots as they are photographed and collected in new areas, and road-killed. Origin, diversity, and structure within populations, kinship, and individual movement pathways will be inferred from this information, and thus, more of the ecological pieces of the ocelot-transportation puzzle can be illuminated.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
218,Effects of Urbanization on White-winged Dove Movement and Breeding Ecology in Texas,"Abstract: The white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica) is an economically important game species in Texas, yet relevant information about demographic parameters and space use patterns that are important informants of management plans are lacking. White- winged doves currently breed in ~200 counties versus <10 in 1980 and only 16% of the white-winged dove breeding population in Texas occurs in the traditional breeding sites in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Outside of the historic range, white-winged doves are predominately selecting for urban environments and preliminary evidence from Texas suggests most white-winged doves breed in the residential core of cities which has unknown impacts on reproduction, survival, resource selection, and movements. This study will address these knowledge gaps using a coordinated telemetry and banding program in conjunction with a study of breeding productivity across urban-rural gradients in the San Antonio and Houston areas, and at traditional breeding sites in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Results from the study will be used to inform sustainable management decisions for white-winged doves at the same time as shedding light on adaptions of wildlife to urbanization.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
219,Effects of Invasive Guineagrass on Northern Bobwhite Space Use,"Abstract: Guineagrass (Megathyrsus maximus), an invasive bunchgrass has a wide range of ecological and agronomic impacts, yet relatively little is known about the effects on Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus, hereafter bobwhite), a species of significant economic importance in South Texas. Guineagrass forms dense stands which may hinder the movement of bobwhite. It also reduces species and structural diversity of local vegetation communities by increasing shade and through the release of allelopathic compounds. As a result, guineagrass is posited to affect the space use patterns of bobwhite, and thus ultimately have implications for processes that drive population size and dynamics. This project seeks to explore these ideas by comparing space use of bobwhite across a gradient over which guineagrass density varies. Space use of bobwhite will be assessed through a combination of spatial-mark-recapture and GPS-telemetry approaches that allow estimations of local population densities and that permit the collection of fine-scale movement data. In so doing, this project will generate baseline data that sheds light on the effects of guineagrass on the space use, resource selection, and behavior of bobwhite. By conducting our study across a gradient of guineagrass density, our study will identify thresholds at which bobwhite are impacted by guineagrass. Thus, results from this study have important implications for the management of guineagrass and bobwhite in South Texas.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
220,Quantifying Cattle Movement through Identified Pastural Trails using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.,"Abstract: The movement of livestock and wildlife through pastures often follows established paths or grazing routes, as animals typically select routes of least resistance between frequently used areas. Over time, these repetitive movements create distinct trails. Traditional remote sensing platforms (>1 m pixel resolution) cannot identify those trails. However, drone-acquired imagery (<5 cm pixel size) allows the identification of these trails. Therefore, our objectives are to 1) determine the feasibility of quantifying livestock and wildlife trails in a pasture, and 2) quantify trail density as a potential indicator of animal use, utilizing high-resolution imagery. To achieve our goal, we selected a study site on a 95.5-hectare private ranch in Jim Hogg County, Texas, USA. We acquired imagery for the pasture during three time periods in 2020 (July, September, and November) and generated orthomosaics, digital elevation models, and digital terrain models. The latter was used to generate a canopy height model to estimate differences in grass height across the pasture. We are in the process of digitizing the trials and estimating the canopy height models. Once these are complete, we will compare them between time periods to assess if there has been a change in trail density and grass height. Our study aims to provide new insights into how drone-based imagery can enhance pasture management by monitoring livestock and wildlife as tools for disturbance, ultimately supporting sustainable grazing practices and wildlife conservation.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
221,Spatiotemporal Patterns in Sex Ratios of Bat Fatalities at Wind Turbines in the United States,"Abstract: Climate change and wind turbines are major threats to bat populations worldwide. Consequently, understanding how to minimize bat fatalities, especially for adult females, while maximizing wind energy production has become a priority for bat conservation and energy development. Reproductive-aged females are particularly important to the population dynamics and stability of bat populations due to their life history characteristics, but morphological sex identification methods have resulted in inaccurate reporting of sex ratios. We used molecular techniques to determine the sex of 6,059 carcasses of Brazilian free-tailed (Tadarida brasiliensis), evening (Nycticeius humeralis), hoary (Lasiuruscinereus), eastern red (Lasiurus borealis), northern yellow (Lasiurus intermedius), silver-haired (Lasionycteris noctivagans), and southern yellow (Lasiurus ega) bats found during turbine searches at 21 wind energy facilities in ten states in the U.S.A. between 2009 and 2022. Overall, there were more fatalities of females than males for silver-haired (pfemale = 0.579, p = 0.008) and southern yellow (pfemale = 0.630, p = 0.009) bats, but not the other species (p > 0.05). The sex ratio of Brazilian free-tailed bats was female skewed in late summer, whereas female skew occurred in spring for eastern red bats and in spring and early fall for evening bats. In Texas, the state with the largest sample size, hoary bats had female-skewed sex ratios in the middle of summer, whereas female skew occurred in the middle of spring and late summer for silver-haired bats. The observed spatial and temporal patterns of fatalities can help inform strategies to reduce female fatalities at wind energy facilities.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
222,Ecological Impact of Varying Vegetation Management Strategies Employed on Solar Farms,"Abstract: Texas is projected to be one of the top producers of solar-generated power, with one-third of the utility-scale projects being constructed in Texas during 2021-2023. Land conversions to solar farms may be perceived as leading to habitat loss and fragmentation, which is the main stressor to declines in biodiversity. The ecological impact of solar farms on biodiversity is not well studied, and peoples’ perceptions of solar farms are mostly based on ‘hypothetical’ information with little empirical evidence to substantiate their hypotheses. The newly constructed Brightside Solar Facility in Live Oak County, Texas is an ideal location to investigate the solar-native vegetation community ecological impacts on biodiversity. After construction in 2021, it was re- seeded with native grassland vegetation and models predict that solar farms with native grasslands will improve ecosystem services and increase pollinator biodiversity. The goal of this research is to obtain empirical data on the ecological impact of the current vegetation management strategies—sheep grazing, occasional mowing, paired with herbicide application—on the biodiversity at the Brightside solar facility. Specifically, investigating the ecological factors from below the ground, up, with a focus on bottom- up drivers. The empirical evidence will serve as a valuable resource to help guide vegetation management strategies that will benefit biodiversity in solar-native vegetation facilities.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
223,Habitat Selection of Bighorn Sheep in Southwestern Montana,"Abstract: Recovery of a population of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in the Highland Mountains of southwestern Montana is thought to be limited by the presence of the bacteria Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (M. ovi), which causes respiratory disease in sheep. This bacteria can cause mass die-offs which decrease lamb survival rates and subsequent population growth. Because M. ovi must be directly transmitted between individuals, habitat selection decisions made by individuals may place them in proximity to each other and put them at risk of transmitting the bacteria. Thus, understanding of the distribution of highly selected habitats as well as the strength with which they are selected may be important for identifying possible hotspots of pathogen transmission. This project seeks to model habitat selection of bighorn sheep in southwestern Montana using resource selection functions (RSFs). We will leverage data from GPS collars deployed on bighorn sheep in the Highlands as well as spatially distributed terrain and vegetation information from the study area. We will evaluate a suite of models containing combinations of variables including land cover, terrain ruggedness, proximity to roads, etc.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
224,Does Small-mammal Herbivory Reduce Likelihood of Native-grass Establishment in Rangeland Restoration,"Abstract: Many factors such as drought, soil conditions, and disturbances influence the success of rangeland restoration. However, the impact of small-mammal herbivory by species such as jackrabbits (Lepus c. texianus), gophers (Geomys bursarius), and rodents (Rattus rattus, Peromyscus megalops, Dipodomys elator) on native plant establishment has been understudied in western Texas. With advancing technology, drones offer a promising yet underutilized method for monitoring small-mammal populations and their effects on vegetation. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of drones in detecting small-mammal herbivory and their potential for assessing plant biomass and species composition. Additionally, we will explore whether correlations exist between small mammal density, plant biomass, and plant diversity. By addressing these questions, we hope to provide insights into the role of small mammals in rangeland restoration and the feasibility of drones as a tool for ecological monitoring.",poster,Professional Poster Session,2025,NA
